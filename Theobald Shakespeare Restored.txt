TO 70 HN RICH Efq;,S IR,,T may seem a little particular, that, when I am attempting to restore SHAKESPEARE, I fliould address that Work to One, who has gone a great Way towards shutting him out of Doors; that is, towards banifling him the Bene- fit of the Stage, and confining us to read him in the Closet. Let me stand excused from intending any personal Accusation here; for it is not You, indeed, but that Affedion, with which Entertain-,A 2 ments
ments of a different Species are pursued, has done this; and therefore I would fain transfer the Fault from You to the Town. Let us lay it upon the Times, as we are pleas'd to do some of our Sins upon Fate and Providence. Or, perhaps, the very Frame of our Nature is concern'd; and the Diffecders of an Eye and Ear can tell us to what Membranes, or Organs, we owe the Communi- cation of 'Pleasures, in which the rational Soul has no Share. So Ihall we be able to account. both for the Reception of GROTESQUE and OPERA.,IF PANTO-MIMING be a Debauchery of the Stage, it is a Vice which is so becoming 'in the Excellence of Your own Performance, that I can scarce find in my Heart to be the first to wish it cur'd. Yet, as it is fabled of A-CHILL.ES'S Spear, that it had a Virtue to heal the Wounds it made; so we may prophesy, one Time or other, that the Rust of PANTOMIMES will be,a
- a,:Salve .for the Recovery of D R A MA T I C Poetry.,I AM, justified in this Address by another Con- fideration, which is, That however you may have been a .Sinner.againft SHAKESPEARE, yOU are not an impenitent one. And as King Henry 1V. ere6ted a Chapel to expiate the Ihijuries which he had done to his Predecessor, King Richard; so, the Town at least fay, you intend to appease the Manes of our POET by ereFfing a MONUMENT to him. Go on in that pious, that reputable Intention; and, while the Taste of the Publick demands it of you, continue to sacrifice frefl Pan- tomimnes to his Memory; when .their Palates alter, convince them that You are provided to enter- tain them with an Elegance suitable to their Ex- pedations.,-BUT I am falln into a Strain which I had no Thoughts of pursuing, when I first fate down to write this Epistle. The great OTWAY dedicated,oine
one of his Plays to his Bookseller, as a Receipt for the Copy-AlJoney; and I meant this merely (fiparva licet componere magnis) as an Acknow- ledgment of some Obligations receiv'd, which you will not expec me to specify in Print. I de- fign'd it to carry the Sentiments of FriendJbip and Gratitude; but, where it falls Thort in those Points, let it make Amends by this Profeflion, that You are always entitled, to the utmost of my poor Power, to demand all the Service of,S IR, Tour most Obliged, and,Faithful Humble Servant, March IS.

SHSAESPEARE reftor'd:,OR, A SPECIMEN of ERRORS, &C.,INTRODUCTION.,HAVE very often declar'd, and that in a num- ber of Companies, that what thro' the Indolence, what thro' the Ignorance of his EDITORs,we have scarce any Book in the EnglifiJ Tongue more ser- tile of Errors, than the Plays of SHdAKESPEARE. And, I believe, whenever I have fall'n on this Subjea, I have not fail'd to express my Wilh, that some fine Ge- nius, equal to the tafl, would befriend the Memory of this im- mortal Poet, and contribute to the Pleasure of the present and of future Times, in retrieving, as far as possible, the original Purity of his Text, and rooting out that vast Crop of Errors, which has almost choak'd up his Beauties.,B IT
I T was no fmail Satisfaction therefore to me, when I first heard Mr. POPE had taken upon him the Publication of SHAK ESPE ARE. I very reasonably expected, from his known Talents and Abilities, from his uncommon Sagacity and Difcernmenrt, and from his unwearied Diligence and Care of informing himself by an happy and extensive Conversation, we ihould have had our Author come out as perfeCt, as the want of i..i.fci'ipts and oi ginl Copies could give us aPoflibility of hoping. I may dare to fay, a great Number of SHAKESPEARE'S Admirers, and of Mr. POPE'S too, (both which I sincerely declare myself,) concurred in this Expecation: For there is a certain curiosa fe- licitas, as was said of an eminent Roman Poet, in that Gentleman's Way of working, which, we prefum'd, would have laid itself out largely in such a Province; and that he would not have fate down contented with performing, as he calls it himself, the dullDitty of an EDITOR only. SHAKESPEARE'S WIorks have always appear'd to me like what he makes his HAMLET compare the World to, an un!ieeded Garden grown to Seed. And I am sorry there is still reason to complain, the Weeds in him are so very sparingly thin'd, that, not to speak out of compass, a thousand rank and unsightly ones are left to flare us in the Face, and clog the Delight of the expeted Profped.,IT must neceflarily happen, that where the Affitfance of iLanrfcripts is wanting to set an Author's Meaning right, and rescue him from those Errors which have been tranfimitted down thro' a Series of incorrec Editions, and a long Interven- tion of Time, many Passages must be desperate, and past a Cure, and their true Sense irretrievable, either to Care, or the Sagacity of Conje&Eure.,A ND there is one Unhappiness too, which generally attends the Republication of Englizj Books, which is, That being the Pro- perty of some Persons in Trade, who, too often, know nothing more of their Copy than that there is a Demand for reprint- ing it; and who are, withal, Persons of such commendable Fru- gality, that they think every Farthing which is given for the Labour of ReviJe, to be so much Money given away for nothing: The Press is set to work from a printed Precedent, and so the,more
more the Editions of any Book multiply, the more the Errors multiply too, and propagate out of their own Species. " Of " this (to borrow the Words and Observation of my ingenious "Friend, * Mr. SEWEL ;) Shakespeare is a very remarkable In- " fance, who has been handed down, from Age to Age, very incor- " rei., his Errors increasing by Time, and being almost conflantly " republifh'd to his Disgrace. Whatever were the Faults of this "great Poet, the Printers have been hitherto as careful to multiply " them, as if they had been real Beauties; thinking, perhaps, with " the Indians, that the disfiguring a good Face with Scars of arti-,ficial Brutes, had improv'd the Form and Dignity of the Per- " Jfn.",THi S, indeed, has not been altogether the Cafe in the late Edition of SHAKESPEARE : The BOOKSELLER, who farms a Right to ome part of this Author, and claims a Right to foime other part of him, has so far mifunderflood himself, (I mean, in ContradiEion to the Rule of Trade,) as to be at the Expence of having his AUTHOR revised; and therefore we promised our- selves, this WoRK would be compleat.,I HAVE so great an Esteem for Mr. POPE, and so high an Opinion of his Genius and Excellencies, that I beg to be excused from the least Intention of derogating from his Merits, in this Attempt to restore the true Reading of SHAKESPEARE. Tho' I confess a Veneration, almost rising to Idolatry, for the Writings of this inimitable Poet, I would be very loth even to do him Justice at the Expence of that other Gentleman's Character. But, I am persuaded, I shall stand as free from such a Charge in the Exe- cution of this Design, as, I am sure, I am in the Intention of it; for I am assuming a Taflc here, which this learned Editor seems purposely (I was going to fay, with too nice a Scruple) to have declined.,To explain nmyfelf I mutl be obliged to make a short Quo- tation from Mr. POPE, in his Preface to SHAKESPEARE : " In " what I have done, fays he, I have rather given a Proof of my " Willingness and Defie, than of my Ability to do hiim Jflice. I,B z " have *, In hb:r Preface to the Szvosilb Iltlme l of the l'Arh of SIIAKÂ£ESI'PAIE, i;, Qlurto.
bhae difclharg'd the duill Duty of an Editor, to ;my best yudgment, r': ith nore Labo!ur th:i 1 expit Tbanks, with a religious Abhor- "rence of ail Innovation, and wtithout any Indulgence to my pri- : va-e Sense or Conjecl:ure." I cannot help thinking this Gentle- man's Modefly in this Point too nice and blameable; and that what he is pleased to call a religious Abhorrence of Innovation, is downright S.,perfition : Neither can I be of Opinion, that the Writings of SHAKESPEARE are so venerable, as that wre Ihould be excommunicated from good Sense, for daring to innovate pro- pi-rly; or that we ought to be as cautious of altering their Text, as we would That of the sacred 1 Vritings. And yet even They, we fee, have admitted of some Thousands of various Readings; and would have a great many more, had not Dr. BENTLET some particular Reasons for not prosecuting his Undertaking upon the New Tefatnent, as he propos'd.,CEPRTAINLY, that Physician would be reckon'd a very un- serviceable Member in the Republick, as well as a bad Friend to himself, who would not venture to prescribe to a Patient, be- cause not absolutely sure to cure his Diltemper: As, on the other hand, he would be accounted a Man of very indifferent Morals, if he rashly tamper'd with the Health and Constitution of his Fellow-Creature, and was bold to try Conclusions only for private Information. The fame Thing may be said with regard to Attempts upon Books: We {hould shew very little Honefly, or \Wisdom, to play the Tyrants with any Author's Text; to raze, alter, innovate, and overturn, at all Adventures, and to the utter Detriment of his Sense and Meaning: But to be so very referv'd and cautious, as to interpose no Relief or Conjeflure, where it manifestly labours and cries out for AffifPance, seems almost as absurd as the Indolence of that good honest Priefi, who had for thirty Years together mistakingly, in his Breviary, read .ii.mpfimin/s for S ,!iupmius; and being told of his Blunder, and fol- licited to correct it, The Alteration tay be jt.fi, said he; but, bo:ve-e;r I'll not change ny old Ml-UMPSIL.s for you1r new SUMP- SI'xFORS.,FOR
F o R my own part, I don't know whether I am mifiaken in Judgment, but I have always thought, that whenever a Gentle- man and a Scholar turnsEditor of any Book, he at the fame Time commences Critick upon his Author; and that wherever he finds the Reading fufpeted, manifetly corrupted, deficient in Sense, and unintelligible, he ought to exert every Power and Faculty of the Mind to supply such a Defea, to give Light and restore Sense to the Passage, and, by a reasonable Emendation, ro make that fatisfadory and confident with the Context, which before was so absurd, unintelligible, and intricate.,THIS is a Task, which, as I above intimated, Mr. POPE has pluprofely difclaim'd, and which I (by what Fatality, or with what Event, I know not;) have taken upon my self to prosecute. I am not insensible under what Disadvantages I must set out upon such a Work, and against such an Antagonifp; ----- impar con- greffls ACHILLI: But as I have laid it down as a Rule to my- self not to be arbitrary, fantastical, or wanton, in my Conjec- tures upon our Author, I shall venture to aim at some little Share of Reputation, in endeavouring to restore Sense to Passages in which no Sense has hitherto been found; or, failing in that Hope, must submit to incur, which I ihould be very unwilling to do, the Censure of a ralh and vain Pretender.,As SHAKESPEARE Rfands, or at least ought to stand, in the Nature of a Classic Writer, and, indeed, he is corrupt enough to pass for one of the oldest Stamp, every one, who has aTalent and Ability this Way, is at liberty to make his Comments and Emendations upon him. This is a Palm, which (as TERENCE said, of writing Comedies) is in common to every poetical Contender:,--.------ In media omnibus Palmam eje pojistam, qui artem traflant muJicam. And he, who has the Luck to be allowed any Merit in it, does not only do a Service to the Poet, but to his Country and its Language. This Author is grown so universal a Book, that there are very few Studies, orColleftions of Books, tho' finall, amongst,which
which it does not hold a Place: And there is scarce a Poet, that our Englif Tongue boaifs of, who is more the Subjec of the Ladies Reading. But with what Pleafire can they read Pas- fages, which the Incorrecmefs of the Editions will not susser them to underfand ? No Vein of Pedantry, or Ostentation of useless Criticism, incited me to this Work: It is a Sacrifice to the Pleafare of SHAKESPEARE'S Admirers in general; and should it fail of all the Success which I wiih, it may chance to work this good Effet, That many will be tempted to read this Poet with a more diligent Eye than hitherto: The Consequence of which will be, that better Criticks will make their own Observations, with more Strength than I can pretend; and this Specimen prove only an Invitation to lead them into nobler Corredions. If, however, till that happens, where SHAKESPEARE has yet, thro' all his Editions, labour'd under flat Nonsense, and invin- cible Darkness, I can, by the Addition or Alteration of a fin- gle letter, or two, give him both Sense and Sentiment, who will be so unkind to fay, this is a trifling or unwarrantable At- tempt ? Or, rather, if I may dare to flatter myself so far, what true Lover of this Poet, who flall find him so easily cur'd, will not owe his Thanks for a Passage retriev'd from Obscurity, and no Meaning? and fay, SHAKESPEARE mufft certainly have wrote so------? But I remember a Line in Horace, which ought to flop me short, and give me tome Fears:,:.id dignuim tanto seret hic promifir hiatu ? I am running too largely in debt, upon Promise, to my Rea- ders, and they are calling for Payment in some Specimens of nmy PerfJrmance.,I am lorry that the Use and Intention of this Undertaking ties nme down to the NecefiSty of one unpleasant Office, That of setting right the Faults in Pointing, and those meerly literal, committed by the Printer, and continued by too negligent a Revifl. This is the Drudgery of Correction, in which I could wish to have been fpiar'd, there being no Pleasure in the Execu- tion of it, nor any Merit, but that of dull Diligence, when exe-,cuted.
cuted. But, uinpLafant as it is, even this Part mull be difpens'd wkih; and all that I can do, to ease miyfelf or Readers in it, is to mark these minute Corrections with all poflible Brevity, and proceed to more important Matter.,I CAxN scarce fufped it will be thought, if I begin my Animadversions upon the Tragedy of HAM1LET, that I have been partial to myself in picking out this Play, as one more fertile in Errors than any of the reft: On the contrary, I chose it for Reasons quite opposite. It is, perhaps, the bell known, and one of the most favourite Plays of our Author : For these thirty Years last pall, I believe, not a Season has elaps'd, in which it has not been perform'd on the Stage more than once; and, consequently, we might presume it the most purg'd and free from Faults and Obscurity. Yet give me Leave to shy, what I am ready to prove, it is not without very gross Corruptions. Nor does it lland by itself for Faults in Mr. POPE'S Edition: No, it is a Specimen only of the epidemical Corruption, if I may be allowed to use that Phrase, which runs thro' all the Work: And I cannot help faying of it, as AEneas does of the Greeks Treachery upon the Inllance of Sinon's,,----------- Crimine ab into 'Dife omnes: ------------ IF HAMLET has its Faults, so has every other of the Plays; and I therefore only offer it as a Precedent of the fame Errors, which, every body will be convinced before I have done, pof- fess every Volume and every Play in this Impreilon.,BUT to proceed from Aflertion to Experiment: In order to which I ihall conflantly be obliged, that the Emendations may fiand in a fairer Light, to quote the Passages as they are read, with some part of their Context, in Mr. POPE'S Edition; and likewise to prefix a flort Account of the Business and Circum- stances of the Scenes from which the faulty Passages are drawn; that the Readers may be inform'd at a tingle View, and judge of the Strength and Reason of the Emendation, without a Refe- rence to the Plays themselves for that purpose. But this,will
will be in no kind necessary, where Faults of the Press are only to be corrected: \Vhere the Pointing is wrong, perhaps, That may not be alone the Fault of the Printer; and therefore I may sometimes think myself obliged to assign a Reason for my altering it.,As every Author is best expounded and explain'd in One Place, by his own Usage and Manner of Expreflion in Others; wherever our Poet receives an Alteration in his Text from any of my Corrertions or Conljetres, I have throughout endeavour'd to support what I offer by parallel Passages, and Authorities from himself: WYhich, as it will be my belt Justification, where my Attempts are seconded with the Concurrence of my Readers; so, it will be my best Excuse for those Innovations, in which I am not so happy to have them think with me.,I H _A E likewise all along, for the greater Ease and Pleasure of the Readers, diflinguith'd the Nature of my Corretions by a ifort marginal Ncte to each of them, viz. False Pointing, Faife Pri-it, r-iot!s Reading, Parage omitted, Conjectural Emendation, Eienation, and the like; so that every body will at once be appriz'd what Subjecl-matter to expet from every refpetive Division.,THE

Tho' all the printed Copies, that ever I have seen, concur in reading Colleagued in this Place, I cannot but think it carries a harih and intricate Sense, and does not so aptly fall in with the Context. This makes me fufpest it corrupted from a Word very near it, both in Sound and Writing, and which carries a much more plausible Meaning, as well as connects better both with what precedes and follows. 'Tis true, Colleagued signifies joined with, putting himself on the Side, or Faction of, &c. and therefore it is not to be utterly disallowed in Sense. But if we can only, with the Alteration of a Letter or two, substitute another Word that gives a stronger and more proper Image, and connects better with the Reasoning of the Passage; I hope, I hall be allowed to offer it, at least, as a Conjedure, if not as a Cor- reEion.

Every Reader of this Poet, however, must have obferv'd how frequent it is with him to use this Figure, (which the Rhetoricians have call'd Anadiplosis;) where he in- tends either to assert or deny, augment or diminilj, or add a Degree of Vehemence to his Expreflion. Of this Usage, were it necessary, I could bring a great Number of Examples; but the Instances, that I can at present remember in him, which seem moll to resemble this before us, are the following.

XIV. Ad i. Scene 3. Page 355. The King, Queen, and Court, quitting the Stage, HAfLETECiJetiara remains, and makes a Soliloquy; beginning with this double Wiih, either that his too solid Flelh would melt away into a Dew,,Or, that the Everlafling had not fixt His CANNON 'gainfl Self-laughter. -- - There is a various Reading upon this Passage, as Mr. Po PE might have obferv'd, which, in my Opinion, merits a Confide- ration, and, pofibly, may give us the Poet's own Words. If he wrote it as it now stands, his Thought is, Or that the Almighty had not planted his Artillery, his Resentment, or Arms of Vengeance againfl Self-murther: But the Quarto Edition, publilhed in 703. (which, indeed, has no other Authority, than its professing to be printed from the Original Copy ;) and the Impression of HAM:LEr set out by Mr. Hughs, Both read,,Or that the Everlafling had notjixt His CA NON 'gainj? Self-laughter. i. e. That he had not rePtrain'd Suicide by his express Law, and peremptory Prohibition. It is a Word that SHAKESPEAR E has ufed'in some others of his Plays; and the Miflake of the Printers is so very easy, betwixt a double and a single n, in Cannon and Canon, that it has atually happen'd elsewhere in our Author upon both these very Words.,CORIOLANUS, pag. 148.,--.---- Shall remain ? Hear you this Triton of the Minnow ? mark you His abfoltte Shall ? Comin. 'Twas from the CANO N.,i. e.
i. e. from the aMouth of the LanP, as Mr. POPE rightly under- stands it; tho' the second Folio Edition has it corruptly, 'Twas fiom the Cannon. So again, on the other hand, twice in the second Acl of King BoHN, the second Folio Edition has it;,The Canons have their Bo-:els frill of IWrath, &c. And afterwards,,Their bart'r;;i Canon, charged to the Alouths, &c. Tho' 'is manifest, in both Places, it ought to be Cannon, with a double n. I cannot help throwing in one Instance more, be- cause the Error has not only obtained in the old and common Modern Editions, but has likewise got a new San&ion in Air. POPE's Edition.,TIrMo, pag. 59.,Religious CANTMrO .TS, civil Laws are cruel, Tjen what fho.ild Aar be? The Propagation of this Fault is-manifestly owing to the Negli- gence of Revisal; and all future Impressions must correa it, --- Religious Canons, &c. But to pass from these Mistakes of thePrefs, there is another Passage in King JOHN, where the Poet. uses the Word Canon to signify Decree or Ordinance, pag. I29.,The CANON of the Law is laid on him, &c. So in CoRIOLA-us, p , pag. 9 20.,-------- lWhere 1 find him, were it At home e uTon ry Brother's Gctard, even there Againf the hospitable C4ANOATNould I Itafh ny fierce hand in's heart. But besides that the Poet frequently employs the Terme, I have two or three Reasons more which induce me to think, that, in this Place of HalLET, he intended the Injunfion, rather than,the
the Artiliery of Heaven. In the first Place, I much doubt the Propriety of the Phrase, fixing Cannon, to carry the Meaning here supposed. The Military Expression, which imports what would be necessary to the Sense of the Poet's Thoughts is, mounting or planting Cannon: And whenever Cannon is said to be six'd, it is when the Enemy become Matiers of it, and nail it down. In the next Place, to fix a Canon or Law, is the Terme of the Civilians peculiar to this Business. This Virgil had in his Mind, when he wrote, gEneid VI.,----... Leges fxit pretio, atque refixit. And it was the conflant Custom of the Romans to fay, upon this Occasion, figere legem; as the Greeks, before them, ufedthe Synonymous Term, aeya. But my last Reason, and which sways most with me, is from the Poet's own Turn and Cast of Thought: For, as he has done in a great many more In- Itances, it is the very Sentiment which he falls into in another of his Plays, tho' he has cloath'd it in different Expressions.,CvrIBELINE,pag. 178.,-------- 'Gains Self-flaughter There is a TPROHIBITIONro divine, That cravens my weak Hand.,XV. Ibid. After HAMLET has finish'd the two before mentioned Wishes; S,,i Po.n- He falls into this Descant on the Grossness of the World, and ,oI Rad- on his Mother's hasty Marriage with his Uncle. i".,How weary, flale, fat, and unproftable [ ] Seem to me all the ifes of this world [? ] Fie on't! oh fie!

Besides that the Heraiflich ..- that it fIhould come thus, .. is very mean and bald, as well as very indifferent EngliJ ; I think, the Editor ought to have taken Notice, that there is a various Reading of old Date; which I verily believe to be the true One, because it makes the Passage much more elegant, and connecive with what follows. The whole Paflfge should be pointed, and stand thus;,How weary, sale, fat., anid unwroftable, Seem to me all the Vses of this WYorld! Fie on't ! oh, fe ! 'Tis an unweeded Garden, That grows to Seed: Things rank, atndgros in Nature, TPofefs it meerly. - - - That it flould come to this - - - But Two Months dead! &c. This is an Exclamation that our Poet makes his Lear, when in the Height of Agony for his Daughter's Ingratitude to him, flopping ihort his Pafion, break into,LEAR, pag. 27;,----- - - Old foind es, Be-eep her once again, I'l pluck you out, A.ndcaftyou. with the Waters that you lose, To tenper Clay. -.- Ha ! - - - Is it come to this ? So likewise Cleopatra, when Anthony is rating and taxing her with Incontinence, for suffering Char's Agent to kifs her hand, fur- prized at the Extremityof his Jealousy, cries out, pag. 38 1.,--------- Oh! s't come to this ? So HAM LET, here, having made his general Reflexions upon the Grossness of the World, breaks into an Interjection of Sur- prize at once, and turns his Thoughts in particular upon his Mother's Condu& with Regard to her second Marriage: And so proceeds gradually to the Consideration of her late Husband's,Tenderness
Tenderness to her, and a Comparison betwixt him and her pre- sent Consort.,XVI. Ibid. So excellent a king, that was, to this, Emendation. Hiperion to a Satyr: So loving to my Mother, That he permitted not the winds of Heav'n Viit her face too roughly, Here, again, is a Passage in which we have a fophiflicated Read- ing, copied from the Players in some of the Modern Editions, for Want of understanding the Poet, whose Text is corrupt in the old Impreflions: All of which, that I have had the Fortune to fee, read,,-.--....- -So loviag to my Mother, That he might not BE TEENE the Winds of Heav't Visit her Face too roughly. 'Tis true, there is no such Word in Englif), that I know of, as beteene; and yet I am verily perfwaded, our Author's Words were so very like it, that it is only a Corruption from the Mif- take of a tingle Letter, and tvwoWords getting too close together.

Page 36I. ------- for on his Choice depends . Conjeard,EmendatioBm e S A N C T I T Y and Health of the whole State. I do not well underfand the Force, or Reason, of the Word Santity in this Place. Does it mean the Sacredness and Reve-,rence
rence due to Majesty ? They could not so well susser by HAMLET'S Choice of a Wife; but the Health, or Preservation, of the State might, in some Degree, be concerned by it. The Quarto Edi- tion of 63 7 has a Various Reading, which I find Mr. Hughs has espoused in his Imprefflon of this Play, vi. The Safety and Health &c. The Meaning, 'tis true, of the Poet is here im- plied, tho' not exprefs'd in his ownTermes; but the Verifiication is miserably crippled by it. To depart therefore not above a Letter or two from the present Reading for the Poet's own Word, as I conceive; suppose, he might have wrote,,------- for on his Choice depends The S ANIT Y, and Health, of the whole State. i. e. The Welfare, Preservation &c. The Word Sanity might not be so well known to the first Editors, as the other; as therefore fufpecling it a hMifake of their Copy, they, with the more Rea- diness, might fubifitute Sanvcity in its Room. Not but this very Term occurs again afterwards in thefecond Ai of this Play. And that Sanity and Health, put together, may not be thought a Tautology to be queftion'd in our Author, in the next Pas- sage, where I find it, it is likewise joined with a Synonymous Word of its own Efficacy and Signification.,HA LET, page. 386.,How pregnant, rfoetiimes, his Replies are . A Happiwefs that often Madnzefs bits on, Which SANITY and Reason coud not be So prorp'7oujly delizer'd of. For by Sanity here is meant not the Health of Body, but Sound- ness ofUnderftanding. Now, to {hew how natural it is for the Press to make a Mistake betwixt Words so like one another, as Sanctity andSanity: It happens that the Quarto Edition of HAMLET, which I above mentioned, printed in I703. reads the very Palfage, las quoted, in this corrupt Manner: ---- How pregnant some- tire his hReplies are! A Happtnefs that often Madness hits on,,which
which Reason and Sandity could not so happily be deliver'd of. Here SanEtity, as in the other Passage, is erroneously fubfitituted in the Place of Sanity. And to deal freely, I have fufpeded that the fame literal Slip upon this Word has been made in another Pas- sage of our Poet: I fay, it has been a Suspicion of mine; for I urge it no farther than as such, and with the utmost Diffidence. However, I shall give it here, as Occasion offers, and submit it to the Decision of better Judgments. The Place is in Macbeth, pag. 580. where Malcolme, Macduff, and an English Physician, are talking of the extraordinary Gift to King Edward the Con- feffor, of curing by his Touch poor Souls that could find no Relief from the Aid of Phyfick, in that Diflemper which fuc- ceeding Times have call'd the King's Evil. The Words are these:,Malc. - ----- Comes the King forth to Day? Doaor. Ay, Sir; There are a Crew of wretched Souls,That flay his Cure; their Malady convinces The great Assay of Art. But at his Touch, Such SANCTITY bath Heaven given his Hand, They presently amend. I do not enirely objec to this Reading that has the Warrant of all the Copies on its Side; nor am I at a Loss, I think, to understand its Meaning. Edward the Confessor was a Man of singular Holiness, for which Heaven blefs'd him with that mi- raculous Power of curing by a Touch. But did the Santity of his Hand do these Cures? Or was it an healing Property impart- ed by Heaven, inReward of his rare Piety ? Certainly, the latter: And This has induc'd me to fiufpea' that our Poet wrote;,--------. But at his Touch, Such SANITY hath Heavengiv't his Hand, Theyprefently amend. i. e. Such a Quality and Power of making whole all whom he touches; This Conjecure, perhaps, will receive some Strength from cer- tain Expreflions in the Reply of Makolme to this Account of the Dodtor. A

But then, in the third Line, why is not --- And you are fltaidfor .. as good, and as full Sense as --- And you are flaidfor there? This Adverb in theClofe seems a dragging and an idle Expletive; and of no Use but to support the Measure of the Verse.

OPHELIA having received the Addresses of HAMLET, Polonius, oher Father, takes her to Task for Indiscretion in too lightly giving an Ear to the Prince's Protetfations. He tells her, that /HAM-LET may walk with a greater Latitude, than her Honour and Reputation will. admit her to imitate: And betides that, being in the Heat of Youth, and professing himself a Lover, his Soul was prodigal to lend his Tongue Vows; which Polonius cautions her to look upon not as the real Sentiments of his Heart, but as Baits to betray her Virtue. Upon which he counsels her thus:,-----.- In few, Ophelia, ')o not believe his 'vows; for they are brokers, Aot of tbat die which their i;ve/ilments shew But meer iinplorers of unholy filits, Breathing like fanciifed and pious BONDS, The better to beguile. ------ Thus indeed all the Imprefflons, which have ever come in my Way, read this Pafiage; even that Edition of HAMLET, revised by the late accurate Mr. John Hughs. I muff own, I have al- ways stumbled at it; and been furprized how Men of Genius and Learning could let it pass without some Suspicion. What Ideas can we form to our selves of a breathing BOND, or of its being fanotif.sd and pious? Surely, so absurd a Thought could scarce come from SHAKESPEARE. The only tolerable Way of reconciling it to a Meaning without a Change, is to suppose that the Poet intends by the W'ord BONDS, Verbal Ob- lig-tions, Proteflations; and then, indeed, these Bonds may, in some Sense, be said to have Breath: But this is to make him guil- ty of overtraining the Word and Allusion ; and it will hardly,bear
bear that Interpretation, at least, not without much Obscurity. As he, just befbre, is calling amorous Vows, Brokers, and Im. plorers of unholy Suits; I think, a Continuation of the plain and natural Sense diredts us to an easy Emendation, which makes the whole Thought of a Piece, and gives it a Turn not unworthy of our Poet. I am, therefore, very willing to fufpe& it came from his Pen thus, tho' none of his Editors have ever been aware of it ;,-.-----. Iwfew, Ophelia, )0D not believe his Mows; for they are Brokers, Not of that Dlye which their Inveftmeits shew, But meer Implorers of unholy Suits, Breathing like Jfanlified and pious BAWDS, The better to beguile. It is usual with our Poet, as his Critical Readers must have ob- served, to give those infamous Creatures the Style and Title of Brokers; of which it may not be amiss to subjoin a few Ex- amples. In his two Gentlemen of Verona, page, 6i. Lucetta, the Servant of Julia, having received a Love-Letter to her Miferefs as in her Name, talia, who has a Mind to {hew a Dif like of this Proceeding in her Maid, thus repremands her.,Now, by my Modefyj an goodl B RO KE R 'Dare yeo prefitme to harbour wanton Lines ? To whijer and conupire againfl my Touth ? Now, trifl me, 'tis an Office of great WYoth; .nd'yot an Officer fit for the Place. Where it is plain that Broker is used but as a more modest Word for Bawd; and the Business of fich a One is defcrib'd in the Lines that follow it.,So likewise in All's well that ends well, pag. 4zo. Helena, dif- coursing with the Widow her Hostess, concerning Count RoJ- fillion's Condua; and the Widow intimating that her Daughter,F z Diana
Diana might have an Affair with him, if ihe pleas'd; Heleina fays that, It may be, the amorous Count follicits her in the unlaw- ful Purpose: To which the Widow replies,,-------- He does indeed, And brokes with all that can in filch a Suit Corrupt the tender Honour of a Maid. Where brokes, or brokers, evidently implies -- tampers with, treats with, as with Bawds.,So likewise in King JOHN, page 142. Falconbridge descanting on Commodity and Self-Intereft, and how all Ranks and Degrees of Persons were subservient to it, and, as it were, feduc'd and betray'd to forsake Virtue thro' its Instigations, uses these Expressions:,That BROKER, that Jfill breaks the Pate of Faith, That daily Break-Vow, He that wins of all, Of Kings, of Beggars, Old Men, Toung Men, Maids; Who having no external Thing to lose But the Word Maid, cheats the poor Maid of That, &c. And, afterwards, a little lower he subjoins,,This BAWD, this BROKER, &c. BESIDES, what itrengthens my Suspicion, and makes this Emen- dation the more necefiary and probable, is, the Words with which the Poet winds up his Thought, the better to beguile. Every Body, I believe, is satisfied that it is the Custom of Bawds to put on an Air and Form of San5ity, to betray the Virtues of Young Ladies; by drawing them firfi into a kind Opinion of them, from their exterior and dissembled Goodness. And Barrds in their Of- ice of Treachery are likewise properly Brokers; and the Implo. rers, and Promoters, of unholy (that is, unchafle) Suits; and for a Chain of the fame Metaphors is continued to the End.,XXVIL
XXVII. WE come now to a degraded Passage, as Mr. POPE fliles it; Emenda- that is, One not receiv'd into the Text, but plac'd (as fufpeded, and too bad to belong to SHAKESPEARE;) at the Bottom of his Page. I must transcribe the whole PafGage, tho' long, before I attempt to set it right; because it happens to labour under false Spelling, false Pointing, false Reading, false Concord, and flat Nonsense. Mr. POPE introduces the Verses with this short Note. [I*Thefe 2 x Lines following are in the firPf Edition, but since left out, perhaps being thought too verbose.1 Since left out? --- I have a Quarto Edition, which, I suppose, Mr. POPE never saw; (printed by R. roung and John Smethwicke, in the Year i637.) where they are not left out; but inserted with an Addition, which, tho' very corruptly printed, when amended; I doubt not will appear to be of our Author's own Writing: And they are again inserted in the other Qarto Edition publish'd in 1703, and in the HAMLET revised by Mr. Hughs. So that they have not been left ott, al- together, from the Time of the firfi Publication. But to the Lines; ---,HAMLET, holding the Watch with Horatio, in Order to fee his A,. sc.- Father's Apparition, a Noise of Warlike Mufick is heard : Which ., Horatiodefirous toknow the Meaning of, HAMLET tells him, that the King fat up to drink, and whenever he took his Draught, the Kettle-Drum and Trumpet proclaim'd the Triumph of his Pledge. Horatio asking, whether it was a Ctifom; HAMLET re- plies, Yes; but one that, in his Opinion, it were better to break, than observe: And then falls into the following Reflexion, how the Danes were reproach'd for Drunkenness, and what a Blot that Charater was in their Escutcheons.,(i.)

The first Three Lines are mighty easily reclified, being only ac- cidentally, as I suppose, wrong pointed; and one Word as acci- dentally, for Want of due Care in the Revisal, wrong spelt: Which XMifakes,-however, both alter and injure the Sense.

Or how can a Vicious Mole be said, or fuppos'd, in any Degree to break down the Fences of Reason, or blemiih the UnderJlanding? A Mole is an exterior De- fee&, appearing upon the Surface of the Skin: and the Over- growth of a Complexion is, as I take it, an unequal Admixture of the Temperaments in the Frame and Composition of our Na- ture; thro' which we become faulty by the Defec of some good, or the Redundance of some ill, Quality. I am unwilling to be too positive in my Corretion of this Place; but, I think from the Tenour of the Context, there is great Room to conjeture that our Author wrote;,So, oft it chances in particular Men, That for some vicious MOULD of Nature in them, &c. When Nature is unequally and viciously moulded, when any Complexion is too predominant, these Accidents may have an,G Effet
Effe& both on Constitution, and the IntelleEual Faculties too; and then Reason, and the other Powers of the Mind, are impair'd and prejudic'd: And this I conceive to have been the Poet's Sen- timent. To make Amends for my Doubt and Diffidence in this last CorreEtion, I'll venture to be more positive in the Next I attempt.,------ That these Menp, Carrying, I ay, the Stamp of one defei , (Being nature's live}'), forrtune's S TAR [ ) The Poet is insinuating, that Men carrying the Stamp but of one Defec, whether it be Nature's Livery, or Fortune's Star, (that is, whether it is owing to Nature, or Accident;) That ihall in Chara&ter overpoife and blemiih the whole Catalogue of their Virtues; and give them the Mark of vicious and corrupt Men. But is Fortune prefum'd to give a Star, where the means a Difgiace? I should much rather suppose it an Ensign of her Favour, than defign'd to set a Mark of Infamy. In ihort, the Cure of this Fault is so easy and obvious, that, I doubt not, but my Readers will acquiesce with me in thinking, that the Poet's Words were;,(Being NTature's Livery, or Fortune's SCAR,) And so the Sense of the whole Paffige hangs together. I am very willing to believe that our Poet intends Nature's Livery as a Term of Reproach, and the Diftincion of some discrediting Z!ality: And, in this Light, I find him using it in his Poem, calld, TARR2UIN and LuCREC.E, pag. 41.,Oh! That is gone, for which I fiught to live,,And therefore now I need not fear to die ; To clear this Spot by Death, at leaf I give,A Badge of Fame to Slander's LIVERY; A dying Life to living lnfamny.,And
And the Word Scar is employ'd by our Poet, not only, in its natural Sense, to signify a Wound in Body; but, metaphori- cally, a Blemish to Reputation. So, in his ANTHONr and CLEOPATRA, pag. 379.,The SCARS upon your3 Honour, therefore, he 5Doespity as conflrained BLEMISHES, Not as deferv'd. (9.)

Not but it is frequent with SHAKESPEARE, whether thro' Neg- ligence, or Licentiousness, to change his Numbers in this Sort.,I COME now to the concluding Sentence of this degradedtm,,fi'^ Passage; Emendation.,(IO.) [----- The Dram of EASE (i .) 5Doth all the .noble Subfanece of A D UBT,To his own Scandal. ] Which, indeed, looks to be so desperate, that, I suppose, Mr. POPE for that Reason only entirely left it out of his Quotation. In reality, I do not know a Paflage, throughout all our Poet's Works, more intricate and deprav'd in the Text, of less Meaning to outward Appearance, or more likely to baffle the Attempts of Criticifin in its Aid. It is certain, there is neither Sense, Gram- mar, nor English, as it now sands: Yet with a flight Alteration I'll endeavour not only to give it all three, but a Sentimient too, that shall make the Poet's Thought close nobly. What can a Dram of EASE mean? or what can it have to do with the Con- text, supposing it were the allowed Expreflion here? Or, in a,G z Word,
Word, what Agreement in Sense is there betwixt a Dram of Ease and the Subfiance of a DOUBT ? It is a desperate Corruption; and the nearest Way to hope for a Cure of it, is, to confider narrow- ly what the Poet must be supposed to have intended here. The whole Tenour of the Sentences foregoing, is, That let Men have never so many, or so eminent, Virtues, if they have one De- fel; which accompanies them, that single Blemifih hall throw a Stain upon their whole Charader; and not only so, (ifI un- derfiand him right,) but shall deface the very Efence of all their Goodness, to its own Scandal; so that their Virtues them- selve-s will become their Reproach. This is not only a Conti- nuation of his Sentiment; but carries it up with a fine and proper Climax. I think, therefore, it ought to be reftor'd;,-------- The TDram of B A S E )Doth all the noble St.bfance of WO RT H 0 U T To his ova Scandal. The Dram of Bfe, i. e. the least Alloy ofBafenefs or Vice. It is very frequent with our Poet to use the Adjeeive of Quality inflead of the Subflantive signifying the Thing. Besides, I have obferv'd that, elsewhere, speaking of Worth he delights to con- fider it as a Quality that adds Veight to a Person, and connets the Word with that Idea.

correted it for WHOM. It may be alledged from these Initances, and some few more that might be gather'd, that this was a Liberty which SHAKESPEARE purpofelygavehimfelf, and that therefore it is not an Error of the Copies. Be this, as it will; if Grammar and the Idiom of the Tongue be diretly against it, we have sufficient Warrant to make him now, at least, speak true Englifb. BUT cO proceed to my Remarks upon the next Line of this Passage,,So horridly to shake our DZifpoJition &c. I fufpea, in the Word horridly, a literal Deviation to have been made from the Poet by his Copyists: and I'll give my Reasons presently for this Sufbicion. But, firit, it will be proper to subjoin my Correction of the Passage, and the Pointing of it, which is manifestly faulty. For, why is there a Note of Inter- rogation at hideous, to divide the Verb from the Second Accusative Cafe which is govern'd by it, when the Question evidently goes on to the very Close of the Sentence? I think, it ought to be pointed, and reftor'd thus;,.--.---- AWhat may this wean ? That Thot dead Corse again in comneat Steel Revititli thus the Glipfes of the Moon, Making Night hideous, and US fools of Nature So HORRIBLY to shake our 'Di:ofition IYith Thoughts beyond the Reaches of our Souls ? Say., &c. The Change of horridly into horribly is very trivial as to the Literal Part; and therefore, I hope, the Reason for the Change will be something more considerable. 'Tis true, horrid and horrible muff be confefs'd to bear in themselves the fame Force and Signification: as horridum and horribile were wont to do among the Latines. But horrid, in the most common Acceptation and Use, seems to signify rather hideous, uncouth, ugly, enormous, than terrible or frightful: and it is generally so applied by our Author. I remember a Passage in his ling LEAR, where it,,H par.
particularly, flands for ugly. It is in a Speech by the Duke of bai., , reproaching his Wife Goneril with her unnatural Be- haviour.,LEA R, pag. 77',-----.. See tlJyfelf, Devil; Proper Deformity seems not in the Fiend So horrid as iin Womian. I cannot, however, deny, but that our Poetfometimes employs the 'Word horrid in the Sense of frightful, terrible: But every ob- serving Reader of his WTorks must be aware that he does it spa- ringly, and, ten times for every once, seems fond to use horrible and terrible. It is obvious, that he prefers both these Terms, as more sonorous and emphatical than horrid; and the Proof that he does so, is, (which laid the Foundation of my Conjec- ture here,) that he almofl constantly chufes them, even where the Nutmbers of his Verse naturally require horrid. I hall sub- join a few Inflances of both for Confirmation; towhichI could have amafi'd twenty times as many; but these are enough, at least, to excuse me, tho' I lhould be deceived in Judgment, from the Censure of being too hyercriticalin my Observation.

Tho' all the Copies, old and modern, agree, in this Reading, I cannot help fufpeEing (at least, till I am better informed of the Force of it ;) the Expression, - - - to fail in Fires. If these are the Poet's Words, his Meaning in them must be, to do Pe- nance in fires : as Faling is often a Part of Penance injoin'd by the Church for our Sins. But could it be any great PAmif- ment for a Spirit, a Being which requires no Suflenance, to faf ? Or could fafling in Fires burn and purge away Crimes more es- featually, than the not being in such a State of Abstinence ? The Poet certainly, in my Opinion, intends to mix the old Pagan Syflem here with the more modern Notion of a local Purgatory; and to intimate, that Souls are cleansed and purified from their Mortal Stains by the Torment of Fire. The Variation will be but very small, to suppose he might have wrote;,And, for the D)ay consn'd to ROAST in fires; Now this takes in all the Ideas necessary to the Punishment, of being burnt, scorched, pain'd, c. (and the Word, thus meta-,phorically
phorically used, conveys no meaner an Image than carving, scalding, raringing, and an hundred other Technical Terms do, frequent in the most elevated Poetry:) But that this was the very Cafe too of our Ghost, his own Words, in a Speech but just before, sufficiently testify.,.------.- ly, Hour is amnofl come, When I to filph'rols and tormenting Flames .nlrft render p vs) self. And our Poet, I remember, afterwards in this very Play, pag. 3 93. again uses the Expression; speaking of Pyrrhts in the Heat of Rage, and running about the flaming Streets of Troy:,-......... ROASTED in Wrath and Fire, &c. There is another fine Passage, that I at present remember, in which our Poet has touched this Subjed of Punishments after Death, and there he does not fay the least Word of fafling in fires: But he makes a Supposition of fiery Floods, like the Infer- ral Rivers, fabled in the old Heathen Poets, and that the Spirits of the Deceased thould be doom'd to bathe in 'em. 1iEA S RE for M.EASURE, pag 363.,4', but to die, and go we know not where: To lie in cold Obflruction, and to rot; Thisei fijble aain Motion to become Akneaded Chd; and the delighted Spirit To BATHE in fiery Floods, or to reside In thrilling Regions of thick-ribbed Ice, To be iilprifoned in the Viewless Winds, And bhlwn with restless Yiolence round about The pendant orld; ------- Now, either to be roafled, or batl'd, in Fire; takes in the Idea of.being burnt and puni/bed; and comes up to the Term among,the
the LATI-ES, exurier igni. VWhoever will allow SHAKESPEARE to have imitated any Passages of the Antients, will, I believe, be of Opinion with me, that in these two Descriptions he had those fine Veries of VIRGIL in his Eye upon this Topick: There are such Strokes of Similitude, as well in the Thought as the Didion, of both Poets.

Emendation Thus Mr. POPE writes this Paifage, as it ought to be; whereas all the Editions, both old and modern, that I have seen, concurr in reading --- fJand an end, &c. And yet this Passage either,seems
seems to have been recified by Chance, or some others, where the fame Phrase recurs, have been revised with a firange Care- leffnefs. For in the Second Part of Hemy VI. pag. 164. we find him reading with the old Imprefions,,Miice Ees fhosld /9arkle like the beaten Flint, Mine Hair be fixt AN e;'d, like One difiranzght. And so in HAMLET, png, 424.,ror;. bedded Hairs, like Life in Excrements, Start up, and fland AN end. j;7 .l.. Whereas in both these Places we likewise ought to refore it,,---ON end. I cannot dismiss this last quoted Passage from HA-ILET, without taking Notice, that I think the Expression - - - like Life in Excrements, as much wants an Explication, as any the most antiquated Word in our Poet wants a Gloss. Alr. HUGHS, in his Impreflionof HArT LET, has left it out; either because he could make nothing of it, or thought it alluded to an Image too nauseous. The Poet's Meaning is founded on a P,5yfcal Determination, that the Hair and Nails are excrementi- tiol!s Parts of the Body, as indeed they are, without Life or Sensation: And yet that Fear and furprize had such an Effea upon HASrLET, that his Hairs, as if there were Life in those Excrements, started up and stood on End: Or, as he expresses it in his TEMPEST, pag. 13.,Wlitb Hair uipfaring~ then like Reeds, not Hair. That our Poet was acquainted with this Notion in Physics, of the Hair being without Life, we need no flronger Warrant, than that frequently he mentions the Hair, as an Excrement. So, Â· Tr.

BUT besides that he so often makes Use of this Term, to put the Matter out of all Dispute, he has the very Thought, which he has here in HAMLET, again in his MACBETH, and ex- prest in much plainer Words, pag. 592.,I have almoj forgot the Tajfe of Fears: The Time has beet,, my Senfels would have coo'd To hear a Night-fhriek, and my Fell of Hair - tould at a difinal Treatise rowze, and tir,As Life were in't.,XXXI.

in its Circumstances, is bad enough, but that the Murther of him was strangely unnatural; HAMLET, impatient to be told the whole Story, fays thus:,Hajfe me to know, that I with wings ass wist As meditation or the thoughts of love, May SWEEP to my Revenge. HB4fLET makes use of the Metaphor here of a Bird using it's Vings fwifrly, to express his Speed in the pursuit of his Re- venge. 'Tis true, to sweep may carry the Sense of gliding fioothbl, and fwifty along; (generally, alongthe Surface of any thing;) but I don't remember the Word ever employ'd to figni- fy the Aaion of a Bird in the Circumtrances ofpurfring its Prey; that is, of moving its Wings irmpetuoufly for that Purpose. In Falconry, a Hawk is said to sweep, when he wipes her Beak after the has fed. But I observe that our Poet, for the moit Part, dses the Word in the plain and natural Sense, of clearing, brujhing away, or trailing on the Earth. So, Second Part of HE-yir VI. pag. 171;,Thy Lips, that kifsd the Quee, shall sweep the Ground. HERrT VII. pag. 541.,Pray, Sir, be patient.

But in none of these Places, or elsewhere that I know, is it con- nected with the Metaphor of Wings, or introduced to denote the Jfwift and furious Descent of any Fowl at Es Prey, or Enemy. I had almost forgot to take Notice, that some of the Editors of this Play seem to have fufpeEted the Propriety of this Word here, by a Change which they have made of it: for both the Quarto Edition of 1703, and Mr. HUGHS'S, have substituted in its Place --- May fly to my Revenge. But to proceed to my own Conjeaure: There is another Word, indeed, so very near it in Sound and Writing, and so peculiar to theBufinefs of a Bird falling on its Prey, that, perhaps, the Poet might have wrote:,Haste me to know, that I, -with FJings asJfwift As Meditation or the Thoughts of Love, May SWO OP to my Revenge. I entirely submit this Conjecure to Judgment; but I am sure it is the very Phrase of our Poet upon an Occafion.of the like kind. MACBETH having murthered the Wife and Children of MAACDUFF, the latter, upon Notice of it, falls into these mixt Exclamations of Tenderness and Resentment. Pag. 583.,IÂ·2 . He

I am very much afraid (and as apt to believe I shall prove it, to the Satisfafion of every Judge, before this Note is ended;) that this PafTage is neither rightly read, nor, as it is read, rightly explained, throughout. In the sirs Place, inflead of unhouz- 7led it ought to be reftor'd - i -uhot.uie'd; from the old Saxon,Word
Word for the Sacrament, husel. So our Etymologifis and Chaucer write it; and Spencer, accordingly, calls the Sacramental Fire, houfling Fire. This, however, is but a trivial Slip, in compa- rifon with the next that offers it self. I don't pretend to know what Glossaries Mr. POPE may have consulted, and trufis to; but whose soever they are, I am sure their Comment is very fin- gular upon the Word I am about to mention. I cannot find any Authority to countenance unaneal'd in signifying, no Knell rung. This is, if I mitfake not, what the Greeks were used to call an a`-,; AEo.:,io,, an Interpretation that never was used but once. Nor, indeed, can I fee how this participial AdjeEtive should be formed from the Substantive Knell. It could not possibly throw out the i, or receive in the a. We have an Instance in our Poet himself, where the participial Adjetdive of the Verb simple from this Subfiantive retains the h ; and so Mr. PoPE writes it there.,MIACBETH, pag. 598.,Had I as mway Sons as I have Hairs, I would not wish them to a fairer 'Death; .nd so his Knell is knoll'd. The Compound Adjective, therefore, from that Derivation muff have been written, unhnell'd ; (or, iuknoll'd; ) a Word which will by no Means fill up the Poet's Verse, were there no stronger Reasons to except against it; as it unluckily happens, there are. Let us fee what Sense the Word unaneld then bears. SKINNER, in his Lexicon of Old and ObJolete ENGIISH Terms, tell us, that anealel is undius; a Prxp. Teut: an, and i Oleleum: so that unanea- let mutl consequently signify, Not being anointed, or, not having the extream UnEtion. But what muff we then do with the Word, immediately preceding it, unanointed? For, the Addition of it is such a manifell and absurd Tautology, as SHAKESPEARE could not be guilty of. We must therefore have Recourse to the Various Readings, and fee if any printed Copies will help us out. The Second Edition in Folio, the Quarto in i 63 7. the,_ - - , " - Hjt0t-
hamlet revised by Mr. Hughs, and several other Impressions, all read, initead of unanointed,,------ DISAPPOINTED, wianerd; as I verily believe it ought to be read. Now, the Word appoint, among other Significations, has that of composing, reconciling: and the Word Disappointed consequently means, unreconcild to Heaven, unabfjolv'd, and no Appointment of Penance or Atonement made for Sin; a Work of the utmost Concern and Moment to a dying Person, And our Poet, I remember, in another of his Plays, as Otbello is at the very Point of killing his Wife upon Suspicion of Adultery, makes him exhort her thus:,OTHELLO, pag. 587.,.If_ yo bethink yourJelf of any Crime Unreconcil'd as yet to Heav'n and Grace, Sollicit for it fJrait. ----- But it happens very luckily too, in Support of the Old Reading which is necefary to be reftor'd here, that the Poet has again, in another Play, made use of appointment in this very Sense of Reconciliation. In MEASURE for MEASURE, Claudio is sentenced to die for having debauched a Maiden, and his Sifter brings him Word, That his Execution is to be instant; therefore bids him prepare his Self-examination, and to make his Peace with Heaven with all Speed. MEASURE for MEASURE, pag. 361; Ifab.

So that, this Reading and this Sense being admitted, the Tauto- logy is taken.away; and the Poet very finely makes his Ghost complain of these four dreadful Hardihips, viz. That He had been difpatch'd out of Life without receiving the (lcfte, or) Sacrament; without being reconciled to Heaven and absolved; without the Benefit of extream Untion; or, without so much as a Confeffon made of his Sins. The having no tnell rung, I think, is not a Point of equal Consequence to any of these; especially, if we confider that the Roman Church admits the Efficacy of Praying for the 'Dead.,XXXIII. Ad I.

The Editor, indeed, has the Countenance of several Editions for this Reading: Tho' here again, as it happen'd in a former Inflance, some of the Editions faem to have fufpeded the Word, and therefore have printed this Passage thus;,These are but wild and windy Words, my Lord, But in what Sense is hurling to be taken here ? It is always used to signify, throwing, carling, darting out, and, as we are told, in the Old ENGLISH, making a Noise: None of which are with. in the Poet's Meaning, who intends, wild and giddy. It muff; therefore, certainly be reftor'd, as my Quarto Edition of 163 7, tho' corrupt in the Spelling, meant to exhibit it.,Tiefe are but wild and WHIRLING WFords, my Lord. The Acceptation of this Word is so universally known, as well as so apt and peculiar to our Author's Meaning, that, I believe,,few
few will doubt that it was his own Expreflion in this Place: And I have nothing more to do (in Support of this Conjeaure, if it needs any;) than to produce a few Instances from him, to shew that he understood and used burl, and whirl, in the re- fpecive and diftina Senses which I have abovementioned to be- long to them.

WE come now to a Speech towards the Conclu1iin of this Faie p;,,t At, which labours under so many Faults of Pointing, as well arnd E. as some of Language, that the Sense is very much perplex'd, and the Text false both in Meaning and Grammar. I must transcribe the Whole first, as it stands; and then give it entire with its Corredions.,K But

Whoever will take this Speech-afunder, and examine the Struc- ture and Conneftion of it, will easily find that something is wanting to support the Sense and Grammar of the Whole. HAElLET is conjuring them to a Repetition of. their Oath of Secrecy, as to what they knew concerning the Walking of his Father's Spirit. Let's dismount it from the Verse, and fee what we can make of the Passage, as the Sense plainly will lead us. Here, as before, fays he, you ll all firear (Jo Mercy help you!) that, however oddly I flall think fit to carry myself, you feeing me Jo transformrd, never shall --- (by Motions, Shruggs, or any am- biguous Giving out to note,) --- that you know any Thing of me.

Then, why, ambiguous Giving out to note ? Does not, ambiguous Giving out, comprehend all the Poet intends here, without Words in the Tail to clog the Clearness of his Meaning?

This do you swear; So Grace and Mercy at your moif Need help you This small Change of two Letters not only gives us a Verb that makes the whole Tenour of the Speech clear and intelligible; but a Verb too, that carries the very Force and Sense which we before wanted in this Place. To denote, as very raw Grammarians know, implies, to signify, to flJer by Marks: And thus it is usual with our Pqet to employ this veryWord. So in OTHELLO, pag. 540.,Othell. 0 moijrous ! monfirrous ! Jago. ------- This was but bis )Dream. Othell. But it DENOTED a fore-gone Conclirion. And so HAMLET, in a Speech to his Mother, upon the Nature of his Grief for his Father's Death, pag. 3 54.,'Tis not alone my inky Cloak, good Mother, Nor cuflomary Suits of solemn Black, Nor windy Sufjiration of forc'd Breath, No, nor the fruitful River in the Eye, Nor the dejected 'Haviour of the ;ifage, Together with all Forms, Moods, She-ws -of Grief, That can DENOTE me truly.,-z K I
I HAVE, at length, got through the first AA of this Trage- dy; and hope, as well for the Ease of my Readers as my self, that, in the remaining Parts, Faults will neither rife so nume- rous, nor require so much Prolixity in the grubbing up. The Proofs of several Kinds, which I have already given to main- tain any Correcdion, must naturally save some Trouble in what is to follow: And I am sufficiently aware what Room my APPENDIX will demand; in which I have engaged to fliew, that the fame Sorts of Errors are scattered through the other Plays; and that SHAKESPEARE is to be reftor'd to his genuine Reading, with the fame Method and Ease of Cure.,XXXV.

Why then flould he caution Reyoldo from putting ANOTHER Scandal on him ? Methinks, there is some Reason to fufpea this Word of not being altogether so proper here, if no Scandal at all had been yet offer'd. There can be no.Second Scandal,supposed
supposed, without a Firfi implied. The Poet's Meaning is, as I conceive it, simply this: To fay, that he wenches, without Aggravation in the Circumstances, lays but a venial Liberty of Youth at his Door; but to fay, That he is open and addi&Eed to Incontinency, amounts to an Habit of Licence, and throws an aaual Scandal. A very flight Change will reconcile the Pas- sage to this Sense; and therefore, if I am right in the Author's Meaning, we may suppose he wrote;,No, faith; asyou may eas'n it in the Charge; Toau mufi notput A N U T T ER Scandal on him, That he is open to Incontinency, That's not my Meaning; but breath his Faults so quaintly, That they may seem the Taints of Liberty; i. e.

Marry3 Sir, here's my IDrift; from Yarions And I believe it is a Fetch of W I T. R'adig. THERE is a various Reading upon this Pafage; which defer- ved the Notice of the Editor; because, if I am not much de- ceived, it seems to have the 'genuine Stamp of our Author upon it. The second Edition in Folio, and some other of the Impreflions, read;,A.nd, I believe, it is a Fetch of WARRA N T. Which I take to be the very Words and Meaning of the Poet for this Reason, because he makes Polonius speak dubiously of his Intention. No body is so doubtful. of his own Judgment and Talents, but that he knows absolutely whether his Drifts and Purposes are designed with Wit, or, no, the he cannot be so,certain
certain, as to their being jtftifiable. A Man may much easier be mistaken, as to the Legality, than as to the Sagacity, of any FaE; because something more than private Opinion, or naked Belief, is wanting to determine positively whether a Thing be warrantable. Besides, I observe, that it is very familiar with SHAKESPEARE to use the Words Warrant and Warranty to figni- fy a Justification. So, (I.)

This Addition of a Syllable gives a little Roughness to the Be- ginning of the Verse; but one Syllable in the firif Foot of it mufl be refolv'd in the Pronunciation; which is very usual, as I have obferv'd, with our Poet. 'Tis true, this Alteration is of no Moment to the Sense of the Paflage; but, methinks, Threeficore thousand Crowns are a much more suitable Donative from a King to his own Nephew, and the General of an Ar- my, than so poor a Pittance as Three thousand Crowns, a Pen- lioa scarce large enough for a dependant Courtier.,XXXIX. Ibid. Page 382. C:-.:, :7TThat He is mad 'tis true; 'tis true, 'tis pity; R:-'. And pity, it is true: ---,Thus, indeed, several of the Editions read this Place; but they don't seem to enter entirely into the Poet's Humour. Polonius, (an officious, impertinent, old Courtier,) priding himself in the Discovery which he supposes he has made of the Cause of HAMLET'S MadnesC, is so full of the Merit of it, that he can't content himself to deliver it in a plain and easy Manner; but falls into an affe&ed jingling Sort of Oratory, as he fancies; and ringing the Chimes, backwards and forwards, upon the fame Words. No Body can read this Speech without observing, that these Figures and Flowers ofRhetorick are not only sprinkled, but poured out, through the whole.

These are. now the FASHION, andfo berattle the common STAGES,(o they call' them,) that many wearrig rapiers are afraid of goose- quills, and dare f-arce come thither. I'll give the Reading first as I think it ought to be reftor'd, and then assign the Reasons.,These now are the FACTION, and so berattle the common STAGERS,(so they call them,) that Alany wearing Rapiers are afraid of Goofe-qills, and dare scarce come thither. The Poet, as it were, here fleps out of Denmark into> England, and makes Ro encrausi in talking of Theatres, allude to the Plays,per-
performed at home by the Children of the King's Chappel; who were in great Eifimation at that Time of day, and out-rival'd the Gentlemen of the Profefion. The Variation of Fahlion into FaEtion we owe to Mr. HUGHS; I think it much the more for- cible and expressive Term: implying, that those Children were not only in Falhion and Esteem ; but were a Prevailing Fation against the other Playhouses, or had a Fadion made by the Town in their Favour. As to the other Alteration of common Stages into common Stagers, which is a Conjecure of my own, my Reason for it is this: The Poet certainly cannot intend by his Many wearing Rapiers, that Gentlemen-Specators were afraid to go to the common Theatres, for Fear of the Resentment of these Children, who so berattled the common Stages. What greater Affront could SHAKESPEARE put upon his Audience, than to suppose any of them were of such tame and cowardly Spirits ? No, if I underhand him, he seems to me to hint, that this young Fry were so pert upon the profeft AÃ³ors, that even they, tho' they wore Swords, were afraid of going near them, least they mhould bebanter'd, or insulted, pall Sufferance. What far- ther induces me to think, it should be common Stagers, rather than common Stages, is, that, in the Speech immediately following, HAMLET, speaking of there Children, retorts upon them, - - - If theyflJould grow themselves to common PLAYERS - - - and does not fay, If they Ihould come themselves to the common PLAY- HOUSES, or Stages.,XLV.

I cannot help observing, that the Beginning of this Speech con- tains one of those Passages in which the Poet may be said to over- shoot himself; andbe guilty of an Absurdity, by making his A&lor iay what he cannot be supposed to know in CharaEter Which is confounding the Pefion of the Drama with a Poeta loquitur. HAiLET, replying to Rofencraus concerning these young Players, afkc, -- IWhat, are they Children? who maitains them? how are they escoted? These Questions argue him a Stranger to them, and their Quality: Yet, without anyInformation, heimmediate- ly after cries, Iill theypnrfue the Quality no longer thant they car firg ? --- which is intimating tacitly, as I take it, that, he knew them to be the Singing-Boys of the King's Chappel: a Know- ledge, no ways to be accounted for, as I can imagine, unless the Poet had given his HA.ILET a Portion of Sir John Fafaffe's lsTiNCT. I must ownr, SHAKESPE4AR is not without some more Samples of these Self-Contradidions; and one Great one, that has been generally imputed to him, will fall under Confi- deration in the next Ad.

Ibid. Page 392. I remember one said, there was No salts in the lines, to make the Var;oi Ru,ding, and 0-. matter fiavoury; nor no matter in the phrase, that might indite m:ffionr- the author of AFFECTION; but' cal'd it, an honeji method. ly- I must own, I can have no tolerable Comprehension of what is meant here by the Word Affection: HAMLET is fpeakingof some Play, to the Stroling Players, which he liked very well, but which did not so currently go down with the Multitude. One, it ,seems, who had a Mind to make a Criticism upon it,. hints, That there was no Matter in its Phrase that could indite the Author of Affecion. Now, what can Affe ion, as a Quality with regard to a Play, signify, but Passion? Yet surely the,Author
Author could not intend to mean that it wanted That. HAMILET speaks to the Maiter-Player to give him a Taste of his Quality in a pafionate Speech; direds him to a Tragedy, which he fays, in his Judgment was an excellent Play, wvell digefled in the Scenes, and let down with as imuch Modefly as Cunning: And then points out a Speech in it, which he chiefly loved, and which contain- ed the Account of Priam's slaughter, and the Distress of Hecuba at the Sight of that terrible Adion. The Subjet alone, never so inartificially told, certainly could not be altogether divested of Pafion. Besides, Could not the Phrase of a Play carry Pas- Pfon with its and yet the Poet use an hone2s Method ? The fe- cond Folio Edition (which, in the Generality, is esteemed as the best Impreflion of SHAKESPEARE;) has a different Reading, which, at least, deferred a flight Notice from the Editor: And which, I believe, is more likely to express our Author's Mean- ing. We, there, find it written thus;,I remeiber, one/aid, there was no Sallets (which Mr. POPE very,justly restores to, Salts) in the Lines to make the Matter Javowuy ; nor no Matter in the bhrafe, that might indite the iuthor of AFFECTATION; but call'd it an honefl Method. i. e.if I underfand it at all, That as there was no Poinancy of J1t or Virulence of Satire, on the one hand; so there was Nothing to condemn it of Affegation, on the other. And if it wanted Affleation, the Poet might more properly be said to use an honefi Method: For Affeftation, is either the Masquerade of Nature in an Habit of Ridicule; or the Abuse of it, by a de- jign'd Disguise of a worse Sort. Three of my Editions (the oldest of which is the Qtarto in I 63 7 ;) exhibit this Passage with an Addition in its Close; which tho' I can't warrant to be the Author's own genuine Words, yet make the Sentence end more roundly, and therefore might have been degraded, at least, to the Bottom of Mr. POPE'S Page, and been noted as an Interpo- lation of the Stage, as, perhaps, indeed they may be. The Words however are these.,--- But

In the first Place, unequal matched by the Position mufl be a Nominative, and consequently relate to Pyrrhus. Now if' Pyrrhus was unequal matched, in the Sense and-general Accep- tation we muff underhand that hewas over-match'd, and had' the worf of it: Not that he was an Over-match for Priam, which was the Truth of the Fa&; I believe therefore it should be, as the second folio Edition has it, ( and the Imprefflon, said to be revised by Mr. ROYE, whether by Chance or De-- sign;) with an Alteration in the Pointing,-..- - -.- Vnequal MATCH !,For.
For the Substantive thus, with a Note of Admiration after it, relates indifferently to Pyrrihus and Priam, and signifies that each was unequal to the other, the first in Strength, the latter in Weakness. But to go lower into the Passage, (tho' all the Edi- tions agree in the Reading,) I can hardly be perfwaded it is printed as the Poet intended it; or that he would have indus- trioufly chosen to prefix an Epithet to ILrUM, which makes a Paradox in the Context. If Ilium was then fenfelefi, why Ihould it seem to feel the Blow ? Or, if Ilim was senseless, wrhy ihould it then seem to feel it ? For one of the two Ways it mufl be taken. I know very well it may be xefolved thus; that Ilium, quoad theBricks and stones, was absolutely senseless yet the Buildings falling into the Fire just at the Infiant when Priam fell to the Ground, seemed, as it were, to be sensible of that Blow. I confess, thismay be a poetical Inference; but a little hard-ftrained, and in no wife neceflary. Perhaps, with a small Variation in the Test and Pointing, the Passage may lie more easy and natural thus.,-------. Vnequal Match Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in Rage firikes wide; B-ut sith the Whif and Wind of his fell Sword ThVnnerved Father falls DOWN SENSELESS. --- Ilium, Seeming to feel this Blow with flaming Top Stoops to his Base, &c. I propose this last Alteration but as a Conjeture; and without laying any Stress upon it: and the rather too, because, per- haps, the whole Paflage concerning Priam and Hecuba may not be of our Poet's writing, but a Quotation from some Play of a Contemporary, which he had a mind to put in the Mouth of a firoling Player. I should, indeed, fufped it to be our Poet's from one Reason only; and that is, from its Subjec. I think the Observation has never yet been made, and therefore I shall -give it here; That there is scarce a Play throughout all his Works, in which it was possible to introduce the Mention of,them,
them, where he has not by Simile, Allusion, or otherwise, hinted at the Trojan Affairs; so fond was he of that Story.,LI. Ibid. But as we often fee-againfl some /form, Enicnd.tio.

THE next, with which my Remarks on this At conclude, is a Slip of such a kind, that I'don'tsknow to whose Account, properly, to place it. There are many Passages of such intole- rable Carelessness interfpers'd thro' all the fix Volumes, that, were not a few of Mr. PoPE's Notes fcatter'd here and there too, I Ihould be induced to believe that the Words in the Title Page of theFirfiJVolume,.-- COLLATED, and CORRECTED by the former EDITIONS, By Mr. POPE,-- -- were plac'd there by the Bookseller to enhaunce the Credit of his Edition; but that he had play'd false with his Editor, and never sent him the Sheets to revise. And, surely, this imuf have been the Cafe Sometimes: For no Body shall perfwade me that Mr. POPE could be awake, and with his Eyes open, and revising a Book which was to be publifh'd under his Name, yet let an Error, like the following, escape his Observation and Corretion.,LIV. AMc 2. Scene 8. Page 397. For mnrther, tho' it have no Tongue, will speak Cr,.nC, With mos miraculous Organ. I'll OBSERVE HIS LOOKS, Play something like the murther of my father Before mine uncle. I'll observe hls Looks, I'll tent him to the quick ; if he but blench, 1 know my course. This is palpable Nonsense, from an Error in the Comnpofitor to the Press; occafion'd by his throwing his Eye two Lines lower than he Ihould have done, and so printing the fame Hemiifich twice over. This Error could not be repeated by an Editor in revising, his Eye and Attention going together in that Task: This, therefore, must be one ofthofe Sheets, which, as I before hinted, were never sent to Mr. POPE for his Revisal. Restore,M 2 it,

I'll HAVE THESE PLAYERS Â°Play something like the 3lurther of ny Father Before mine 'uck. I'll oberve his Looks; I'll tent him to the ,ic k; if he look pale, I kn:o myy Cotfie. But because it may seem a little too hard, upon a tingle In- fiance of this kind, to fufpea that the Sheets might not be all revised by the Editor, as I just now hinted; I'll subjoin an- other flagrant Testimony of the fame Sort of Negligence: And I ihall do it the more willingly, because I would embrace an Opportunity of clearing Brutus from the Imputation of a Mur- ther, which SHAKESPEARE is made to throw upon him, tho' he never had it in his Head to think him guilty of it.,TYILLIAM de la Poole, the wicked Duke of Suffolk, being banish-. ed out of England by King Henty the Sixth, as he is making off in Disguise, is upon the Coast of Kent taken by Pirates: And behaving himself to them in a Manner they did not care to brook, was ordered to the long Boat's Side, there to have his Head firook off. As he is dragging away, he comforts himself that his Death will be memorable, from the Circumfance of his being murther'd by such mean and vile Fellows; as it had. happen'd to many Great Men before him. Second Part of HEN' r VI. pag. 173. Omnca That this my death may never be forgot.,Great men oft die by vile Bezonians. A Roman fv-order and Bandettoflave Murther'd feet Tully. Brutus' bafJard hand Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.,Tully
Tully indeed was kill'd by Herennius a Centurion, whom the Poet here calls, by way of Ignominy, a Roman Sworder; and by Popilius a Tribune, who is likewise here call'd a Bandetta Slave, probably, because he had formerly murthered his Father, and was defended, upon his Tryal for that Fad, by Tully. But would not any Body now, taking Mr. POPE's for a corrcEt and infallible Edition, begin to wonder how SHAKESPEARE could be so precise in Roman History as to the Death of Cicero; and so ignorant, as to lay the Murther of Pompey upon Brutus ? If we were to take this Fa& for granted, we should find our Poet guilty of a strange Self-Contradi&ion, or Pompey the Fa- ther of a very degenerate Son. For Sextus Pompeius, in ano- ther of our Author's Plays, gives Brutus such a Charadter and Commendations, as no Man certainly would bestow on his Fa- ther's Murtherer. See AN THON r and CLEOPA TRA, pag. 34 .,-.----Â ----- 1 do not know, JYherefore ny Father should Revengers want, Having a Son and Friends; since Julius Csear, (WhIo at Philippi the GOOD Brutus ghofed,) There saw you labring for him.

And that is it Hath made me rig my Navy: At whore Burthet The anger'd Ocean foams, with which I meant To courge th' Ingratitude that defiteful Rome Calf on ny noble Father. The Sentiments of filial Piety, and Resolutions of avenging his Father's Murther, are too itrongly exprefs'd, to suppose he would in the fame Breath bestow an Encomium on the Man who kill'd,- him
o: .': him. But when I first quoted this Passage, I little fufpe&ed,it would have furnithed frelh Work for Corretion. What! were the Confpirarors presumed to have kill'd CASSAR, becaulfe tbLy would have but one MIan, a Man? What Mock-reafoning ,is this ? If they would have but one an;a, a tman, (i. e. a Man am' i;:;.- a Man eminent above, and over-topping, all others;) it was the Height of char's Ambition to be such a One, and therefore they should rather have let him live. If I underhtand the Meaning of the Poet, he would infer, that the noble Confpi- rators ilabb'd C.far, because they would have, or susser, any one Man to be but a Llan; i. e. they would have no one aim at arbitrary Power, and a Degree of Preheminence above the reft. Restore the Place therefore with the second Folio Edition;,------------.-- ut that they w'ould Have One Man, but a Man ? -But to return again to the Question of Pompey being kill'd by Brutus. I have before hinted, that our Poet never defign'd a Charge of this fort against poor Brutrus; and in short, SHAKE- SPEARE will presently stand acquitted of this Blunder; and the Fault appear to have arisen from a Negligence of Revisal, or rather from the \ant of revij:ig at all. But that this Suspicion of mine may not appear a meer gr.its dicum, I'll now give the Reason that induced me to it; and from which, I think, the Source of the Error may be fairly accounted for. The, Cafe is, a Material Lineis left out, in this Passage, by Mr. POPE'S Impression; which very Line is left out of another Edition, in Duodecimo, likewise publifi'd by Mr. Tonfon about ten Years ago; so that it seems most probable, that the Press was set to Work and corrected by this Duodecimo Edition; without any Collation with the old Editions mentioned in Mr. POPE'S Table of Editions at the End of his Sixth Volume. This Deduction, I am sure, is fair and natural: for the second folio Edition (one of the Editions there mentioned,) exhibits the Passage entire, and as the Poet wrote it: and even the fourth Edition in folio (-ahich, indeed, is but a faulty one;) printed no longer ago than,the
the Year I 68 , likewise has it as it {hould be. Restore it there- fore with them, and we come back both to the Truth of the History, and the Poet's Text into the Bargain.,That This my (Death may never be forgot. Great Men oft die by vile Bezonians. A Roman Sworder, and Bandetto Slave Mtirther'dfweet Tully. Brutus' baflard Hand STAB'D Julius Cxfar. SAVAGE ISLANDERS Pompey the Great: And Suffolk dies by Pirates. I cannot help, tho' this Passage has already taken up some or,.a Length, throwing in an Explication upon it, which will benew tofome Readers, atleaft, of SHAKESPEARE: and, consequent- ly, I shall not lose all my Labour in it. I had once a Suspicion that the Poet intended to make Suffolk reproach Brutus with Cowardice, for dishonourably flabing CGfar; and that the Text, to support this Meaning, ihould have been alter'd to,--------- Brutus' DASTARD Hand Stab'd Julius Cefar: A Mistake of the like kind has happen'd upon the very fame Words in another of our Author's Plays. In King Richard II. Bolingbroke being required to throw down the Duke of Norfolk's Gage, and withdraw his own Challenge, refuses at first upon a point of Honour, and throws out this contemptuous Reflexion against the Duke.,Shall I seem crefl-fall'n in my Father's Sight? Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my Height, Before this ont-dared DASTARD? - -- Where some of the Editions erroneously express it,,Before this out-dared BASTARD? :--,But
But I have fnce found Reasons to retraE this Opinion, and to be convinced that the Poet, in calling Brutus BASTARD, designed a much deeper Contumely than That of Cowardice; zil. the blackest Ingratitude and most detestable Parricide SHAKESPEARE has elsewhere taken Notice of CGfar's exceflive Love to Birutus, and of the Ingratitude of the latter for being concern'd in his Murther. JULIUS CÂ£.SAR, pig. 27I,,7Thro' This the well-beloved BR'VVS flabb'd, And, as he pluck'd his cursed Steel away, Mlark how the Blood of Cefar follow'd it! As robiing out of 'Doors to be refolv'd.

We know Nothing from hence of the Spring of Cfar's Affection, or why Brutus, even for assisting in his Murther, should be ftigmatiz'd with Baflardy. As this Piece of secret History is no whereelfe so much as hinted at, that I know of, or can recol- let, throughout all our Author's Works, I {hall give it from PLUTARCH in the Life of MARCUS BRUTUS. Clefar, before the great Battle of Pharfalia, had order'd his Commanders to spare Brutus, and. bring him safe to him, if he would willing- ly surrender himself: But if he made any Refifance, to sus- ser him to escape, rather than to kill him. " And this he " is believed to have done (fays the HISTORIAN,) out of a " Tenderness to Servilia, the Mother of Brultus : For Gefar,had
': had it seems, in his Youth, been very intimate with her, "and he passionately in Love with him. And confidering " that Brutus was born about that Time, in which their Loves,were at the highest, Cefar had some Reason to believe that he "was begot by him." --- This SHAKESPEARE knew, and therefore reviles Brutus with being the Baflardlflue of the Man whom he so ungratefully kill'd.,LV. Ad 3. Scene r. Page 399. Good Gentlemen, give him a further edge, R""im ' And drive his purpose INTO theef delights. But Two Speeches above, Rofencraus had informed the Queen, that there did seem a kind of Joy in Hamlet to hear of the Ac- tors Coming, and that they had already Orders to play before him: What Occasion, therefore, was there to drive his Purpose into these Delights ? He already feem'd to give into them; and the King desires Rofencraus and Guildenflern to promote and further that Bent and Disposition which Hamlet shew'd to that Sort of Pleasures. I think, therefore, the second Folio Edition expresses this Pafiage more rightly;,Good Gentlemen, give him a further Edge, And drive his Turpoft ON TO these sDelights. And so the Poet expresses himielf before in the second AS of this Play, where the King entreats Rofencraus and GuildenfJern, as old School-fellows of Hamlet, to flay a while at Court in or- der to divert him. See pag. 379.,---.--- --- I entreatyou Both, That being of o young )Days brought up with him, AJnd Jice so neighbour'd to his Touth and Humour, That Ton vouchJafe your Reft here in our Court Some little Time, so by your Companies To draw him ON TO Pleafieres, -----,N LVI.

To take Arms againif a Sea, literally speaking, would be as unfeafible a Projec, as the Attempt (mentioned in a Speech of the Lord Haverflam, in a late Reign;) to flop the Tide at Gravesend with a Man's Thun.bm. Mlr. POPE subjoins a Note, that instead of a Sea of Troubles, it might have been --- perhaps, liege; which continues the Metaphor of flings, arrows, taking Arms; and represents the being encosiioped on all Sides with Troubles. The EDITOR is not the firfl who has had the fame Suspicion : And I may fay, be- cauie I am able to prove it by WVitneffes, it was a Guess of mine, before he had enter'd upon publilhing SHAKESPEARE. But, perhaps, the Correction may be, at belt, but a Gurefs; con- iidering the great Liberties that this Poet is observed to take, elsewhere, in his Diction, and Connexion of Aetaphors: And con- sidering too, that a Sea (amongst the antient Writers, sacred and prophane, in the Oriental, as well as the Greek and Latin, Tongues;) is used to signify not only the great, collected, Body of Waters which make the Ocean, but likewise a vast Quanti- ty, or Multitude, of any thing else. * The Prophet Jeremiah, particularly, in one Passage, calls a prodigious Army coming,up r Â£ .

So here, I conceive, to take Arms againfl a Sea of Troubles, is, figuratively, to bear up against the Troubles of human Life, which flow in upon us, and encompass us round, like a Sea.,BUT there is another Passage in this Soliloquy of HAMILET, which, I hinted, in my Remarks upon the last A&, would demand some Consideration in its proper Place; and, there- fore, it naturally falls in here.,But that the 2Dread of Something after TDeath ditionit!. (That undifcover'd Country, from whose Bourn 'P,,oex No Traveller returns ;) puzzles the IVill; And makes us rather bear those Ills we have, Than fly to Others that we know not of. The Criticks have, without the least Scruple, accused the Poet of Forgetfulness and Self-Contradiaion from this Passage; feeing that in this very Play he introduces a Charader from the other World, the Ghofi of HAMLET'S Father. I would not be so hardy to assert peremptorily, that SHAKESPEARE was aware of this seeming Absurdity, and despised it; any more than I would pretend to justify him against this Charge to all his Ob- jetors. If he foresaw any thing of it, perhaps, he lhelter'd himself from their Criticisms under some Reserve like this. 'Tis certain, to introduce a Ghofi, a Being from the other World, and to fay that no Traveller returns from those Confines, is, literally taken, as absolute a Contradiaion as can be sup- posed, &fasto & terminis. But we are to take Notice, that SHAKESPEARE brings his Ghost only from a middle State, or local Purgatory; a Prifon-houfe, as he makes his Spirit call it, where he was doom'd, for a Term only, to expiate his Sins of Nature. Bythe undiscovered Country, here mentioned, he may, perhaps, mean that lafi and eternal Residence of Souls in a State of full Bliss or Misery: which Spirits in a Middle State (either under Purgation, or in the Prisons of Hope, as, I think, oneof the APOSTLES calls them;) could not be acquainted with, or ex-,N z plain.
plain. So that, if any Latitude of Sense may be allow'd to the Poet's. Vords, tho' he admits the Possibility of a Spirit returning from the Dead, he yet holds that the State of. the Dead can- not be communicated, and, with that Allowance, it remains fill an zuntdifcovier'd Country. We are to observe too, that even his Ghost who comes, as I hinted above, from Purgatory, (or, what- ever else has been understood under that Denomination;) comes under Refiritions: And tho' he confesses himself subjet to a Vicissitude of Torments, yet he fays at the fame time, that he is forbid to tell the Secrets of his Prifon-hotfe. If these Qualifi. cations will not intitle the Poet to fay, that no Traveller re- turns from the Verge of the other World, i. e. to disclose any of its iyfteries, without a Contradiction to the Liberty he has taken of bringing Apparitions upon the Stage; it is all the Sal- To I can put in for him, and I must give him up to the Mer- cy of the Cavillers. The Antients had the fame Notions of our abstruse and twilight Knowledge of an After-Being. VALE- RuVS FLAccUs, I remember, (if I may be indulged in a ihort Digrefflon,) speaking of the lower Regions, andState of the Spirits there, has an Exprefion which, in one Sense, comes close to our AUTHOR'S undiscovered Country ; vi. --- Stperis incognita Tellus. And it is observable that VIRGIL, before he enters up- on a Description of Hell, and of the Elyflan Fields, implores the Permilion of the Infernal Deities, and professes, even then, to discover no more than Hear-Say concerning their Mysterious Dominions.

The Note of Dilnatus upon this Passage is very remarkable to our Poet's SubjeE: But That the Curious may refer to at their Ldfure. I SHALL conclude all I have to remark on this fine Soliloluy, when I have fubjoin'd an Explication to one Word; in whith, perhaps,,I may
I may take the Poet in a Meaning different from what the Gene- rality of his Readers underfiand him. But if my Singularity in this Point be juflify'd by a Reason, I hope it will secure me from the Censure of being idly Jingular. He is faying, That were it not for the Dread of an unknown State after this, who would bear the Plagues and Calamities here, when he could himself put an End to them, and his own Life too ? His Words are these;,For who would bear. the Whips, and Scorns of Time, Occasional,Gloss. IWhen as himself might his Quietus make With a bare BODKIN ? I know that the Poet is generally interpreted to mean in this Place, When we might give ourselves a Release by any, the leaf, Weapon of Offence that can be. 'Tis true, This exaggerates the Thought in that particular; but I can scarce suppose that hein- tended to descend to a Thought, that a Man might dispatch himself with a Bodkin, or little Implement with which Women separate, and twist over their Hair. I rather believe, the Poet designed the Word here to signify, according to the old Usage of it, a Dagger. Tho' the Glossaries give us no such Interpreta- tion, the use of an Old and Learned Poet, who may weigh against their Comments, I am sure will support me in it. CHAUCER, in his Monke's Tale, recounting the Murtherof 7tdlis Cefar, has this Stanza.,This Julius unto the Capitol weent, )pon a day, as he was wont to gone, And in the Capitol anon him hent This false Brutus, and his other fine, And flicked him with BODKINS arione WFith many a WIound, and thus they let him lie: But never grutch'd he at no fJroke but One, Or else at tz'o, tbt if his floy lie.,?Tis
'Tis plain, that the Poet here means Daggers by this Word: And no one ever yet thought that Brutus and Caflius, or any other of the Conspirators, stabb'd Cofar with their Ladies Bodkins.,LVII. Ac 3.

'Tis either none, or in extremity ; Now what my love is, proof bath nade you know, And as my love is SIX'D, ny fear is so. So several of the Editions exhibit this Passage ; but, I think, the Sense of the Context {hews it to be wrong. My Qyarto Edition of 1637 has it;,Aid as my Love is CIZ'D, my Fear is so. And the Second folio Edition reads,,And as my Love is SIZ, my Fear is so.,Now;
Ionw, from these two mistaken Readings, and as the Queen evidently is talking here of the Quantity of her Love and Fear, their Proportion, not their Continuance or Duration, I am per- fwaded, the whole Pafage ought to be reftor'd thus;,And [omen's Fear and Love hold Quantity, 'Tis either None, or in Extremity ; NTow what niy Love is, Troof bath made you know, And as ny Love is SIZ'D, nmy Fear is so. i. e.

LXII. Ibid. This is one Lucianus, nephew to the KING. Emendatiou. All the Editions whatever, 'tis true, concur in this Reading; and therefore we are to presume the Blunder was original, either in the Poet's Inadvertence, or the Miltake of the first Transcript. Nephew to what King ? The Story of the introduc'd Play is the Murther of Gongago, Duke of Vienna: As is plain from the preceding Part of this very Speech. It therefore ought to be correced, in Spight of all the printed Copies;,This is one Lucianus, Nephew to the DUKE. So, wherever the Player-King and Q!teen are mentioned, it ought to be DUKE and DUTCHESS. The Source of these Mirtakes is easily to be accounted for, from the Stage's Dref- sing of the Charaaers. Regal Coronets, perhaps, being by the Poet at first ordered for the Duke and Dutchess, the succeeding Players, who did not so firicly observe the Quality of the Characers and Circumfiances of the Story, mistook them for a King and Queen ; and so the Error was deduced down from thence to the present Times.,LXIII.

'Tis too foul a Blot upon our Reputations, that every Husband that a Woman takes must be worse than her former. The Poet, I am pretty sure, intend-,o ed

So you mistake Habamnds. lizftake, in the Last Line, runs thro' all the printed Copies, that I have ever seen, from the fecondfolio Edition downwards. ir. POPE, who very justly reflores the true Reading there, takes no manner of Notice of the Various Reading in the last Line but One: Tho', if I underhtand the Poet's Conceit at all, the whole Smartness of the Repartee depends uponit. I think, therefore, the entire Passage ought to stand thus.,Ophel. To2 are keen, mny Lord, you are keen. Haml. It -world cofi Torn a Groaning to take off mie Edge. Ophel. Still BETTER and WORSE. Haml. So you muf take your Husbandsr. In ihort, HAMfLET has been all along talking to the young Lady in double Etendre's, or, rather, in a Strain of Freedom which scarce admits of that nice Ditlinfion. She tells him once be- fore, that he's naught, and fle'll mark the Play. He still keeps up his Vein of Drolleiy, and throws in such plain Hints, that ihe is forced to parry them by an indirec Answer; and re- marks, as I conceive, that his Wit is smarter, tho' his Meaning is more blunt. This, I think, is the Sense of her --- Still bet- ter and worse, - - - and then there is some Reason and Acute- ness in HAM1LET's Anwver, So you mutl take your Husbands. For he certainly alludes to the Words in the Church-Service of MIatrimony, where the Husband and W ife promise alternately to take each other for BETTER, for WORSE; for richer, for poorer, &c.,LXIV.

As Hamlet had thrown some apposite Lines into the Play, in Order to sift the King's Conscience as to the Fat of his Father's Murther, and was resolved to watch his Looks and Behaviour narrowly during the Representation; when the Scene comes to touch the Poyfoning in the Garden, and the King, itruck with the Image of his own Deed, caa set it out no longer, methinks; it is very improbable that Hamlet, upon this pleasing Stroke of Convi&ion, flould not express his Satisfaaion in one half-line at least, upon the Play having a proper Effefd, and his being convinced of his Uncle's Guilt. The Passage ought certainly to be supplied from the Second Folio Edition, and Three more inm- prefions now before me.,Ophel. The King rifes. Hraml. What, frighted with false Fire? Queen.

Hamlet, applauding himself upon the Discovery his additional Lines in the Play have made of his Uncle's Villany, asks Hora- tio, whether he does not think, that his Skill, and a few Thea-,0 trical
trical Equipments join'd with it, would not, upon a Shift, help him into a Share among the Players by their own Voices. But, what are we to understand by ray'd Shoes? Mr. POPE tells us, at the Bottom of his Page, that in some Books he had found it rac'd; in others, rack'd. 'Tis true; and no less than three Edi- tions that I know of, (viz. the Quarto's of 1637 and 1703, and Mr. Hugbs's Imprefion,) have it, ra'd : And all the four Readings, I believe, are equally mistaken ; tho' the last mention- ed, perhaps, will bring us nearest to the true one. 'Tis plain to me, Hamlet, from the Discovery that his Lines in the Play have extorted, is complimenting himself on his Tafie and Judg- ment in the Powers of Tragedy; and seems to think that he wants Nothing but a Stock of Plurmes, and Buskins, to set him up for one of the Profeflion. If this be the true Sense of the Passage, as I believe verily it is, I am apt to think the Poet wrote it thus.,Wzouldnot This, Sir, and a Forest of Feathers, if the reft of my For-,tunes turn Turk with -Ie, with two provincial Roses on myRAIS'D Shoes, get me a Felwrfhip in a Cry of Players, Sir By rais'd Shoes, as I take it, he means the Tragedy-Buskin, (or Cothurnus, as it was call'd by the Romans;) which was as much higher in the Heel than other common Shoes, as the Chioppines, worn by the Venetians, are, mention'd by our Poet in the fore- going AS of this Play. It was the known Cuflom of the Tra- gedians of Old, that they might the nearer resemble the Heroes they personated, to make themselves as tall in Stature, and, by an artificial Help to Sound, to speak as big, as they possibly could. But of this I shall have Occasion to speak more at large in the Difeitation to be prefix'd to my Translation of EscHTrLs's Tra- gedies. HORACE, in his short History of the Progress of the Stage. takes Notice of these two Things, as peculiar Supplements to Tragedy; ---magnmYnqle loqui, nitique Cothurno: And SHAKE- SPEARE himself, in his Troilus and Cressida, seems to rally the Acors both on Account of firetching their Voices and Persons,,(Pa1g. 24 ),And

The Generality of Editions have anotherReading, (which is, indeed, a corrupt one as printed,) but Mr. POPE has espoused This, and subjoined a Note for his Reason; that it alludes to a Fable of the Birds chufing a King, inflead of the Eagle, a Peacock. I suppose, the EDITOR must mean the Fable of Barlandus, in which it is said, the Birds, being weary of their State of Anar- chy, moved for the setting up of a King. The Peacock, on Ac- count of his gay Feathers, put in for the Office; and the Choice upon the Poll falling to him, a Pye stood up with this Speech in his Mouth; May it pelafe your Majefly, fays he, we fl7ould be glad to know, in CaJe the Eagle flould fall upon us in your Reign, as he has formerly done, how will you be able to de- fend us? But, with Submission, in this Passage of SHAKESPEARE, there is not the least Mention made of the Eagle, unless, by an uncommon Figure, yove himself llands in the Place of.his Bird. Then, we do not find that Hamlet intends tofpeak of his Uncle, as of a Person unable to defend the Realm; nor, indeed,. do we find that the Realm had been yet attack'd, or wanted a Defender. In ihort I think, Hamlet is here setting his Father'sand8 Uncle's Charaeers against each other; and means to fay, that by his Father's Death, the State was fiript ofa Godlike Monarch, in Ex- cellence rivalling Jove: And that now, in his stead, reign'd the most defpicablenimal that could be. I fay, thatHamlet intends a Compa- rifon betwixt his Father and his Uncle; or, at least, to speak greatly to the Disadvantage, and in Contempt of the latter. But the,Peacock,
Peacock, surely, is too fine a Bird to be thus degraded; tho' the Eagle has the Preference in Strength, Spirit, and Fierceness. Betides, what Features of Resemblance are there betwixt a tame Peacock, and a King, who had Courage enough to usurp a Crown, to make away with his own Brother to make way for himself, and to justle his Brother's Son, Hamlet, out of the Eletion, tho' he was a Favourite of the People ? ft. C;.:, WVere it necessary to suppose, that the Poet meant, Hamlet,ihould revile his Uncle here for a tame, cowifll Spirit, and as one inheriting none of the masculine Qualities of his Predecessor; the Change of a single Letter will give us this Sense, and a Word too that has the Warrant of our Poet, in another Place, to bear that Signification. I would then read,,.----------- and now reigns here A v-,vey, MEACOCK. Now a * aiot;R or Enoccf;, betides its proper Signification ofa cravenly Bird, is taken metaphorically to mean a daflardly effemi- rnre Fellow: And in that Acceptation we find it used in the T__INxG of the SHREW, pag. 312.,Oh, yot are ANovices; 'tis a WJorld to fee, Ho-o tame (wheen Men and IWomen are alone,) A MEACOCK iWretch can make the crrfteft Shrew. But not to fix ourfelres down absolutely to this Reading, let's sirs have Recourse to the various Reading in some of the Copies, and fee what Help we can derive from thence.

Where the Haggs speak of the Screaming of the Cat, and the Croakingof the Toad, which they are supposed to hear from the Or- gans of their Familiars.

i. e. a ravenous Kite, a mere Bird of Prey; a Devourer of the State and People; without any of the Excellencies and defensive Virtues of the Royal Eagle, his Father ?

But what might go a good Way towards fupporcing a Conjeture that this was our Author's Word here, is, that there is a pari- cular Passage in another of his Plays, whlere the Fagle and Put- tock are placed comparatively, and in a Light of Opposition to one another.

All the Editions concur in the Deficiency of a Foot; but if we can both cure the Measure, and help the Meaning, without a Dif- grace or Prejudice to the Author, I think, the Authority of the printed Copies is not sufficient to forbid a Conjeture.

He hits upon that particular Point, on nrhich the BE N T of each Argument turns, or the Force of each Aotive depends. I did not think, when I began this Work, to collate the more recent Folio Editions, especially the fourth, pub- lifh'd in 168 5, for I had it not then by Me; but upon throw. ing my Eye over it lately, I find it is there printed, as I have here correced it - a more horrid B E N T.

Surely, Ham. iet does not so much wish that the Queen was not his Mother, as that She was not his Uncle's Wife. He loves and honours her as his Mother; and therefore, out of those Regards, wishes She had not that Disgrace upon her Chara&er, of having married his Uncle, whom he knew to be his Father's Murtherer. The Pafage, certainly, ought to be distinguished as the second Folio Edition, and several other of the better Copies, lead the way.,Queen. Hav-eou forget me ?

us, that geam i is properly the Fdt, or Grease, of a Hog: And tho' I do not remember the compound Adjective from it used in any other Place of the Poet than this before uS; yet he has else- where employ'd the Subflantive; and making Ulyfes speak con- temptuoufly of Achilles, who had fequePter'd himself from the Grecian Captains and the War, he compares him tacitly to a Hog in his Sty, feeding on his own Pride, and Self-fufficiency.

The Quarto Edition of 1637 has an Addi.tion in this Place, which has beenadmitted into most of the modern Editions; tho' it has not the Authority of any earlier Date in Print, as I know of, than that utarto; and yet seems to bear the very Stamp of SHAKESPEARE upon it. The Coin, indeed, haseen clipt from our first receiving it; but it is not so diminified, bit that, with a small Allifiance, we may hop.e to make it pass current.

We have not, indeed, so much as the Footfreps, or Traces, of a corrupted Reading here to lead us to an Emen- dation ; nor any Means left of restoring what is loft but Con- jeAure. I ihall therefore offer only what the Sense of the Con- text naturally seems to require.

If' the Letters, importing the Tenour of the Process, were to: that Effet, they were certain- ly congruing; but of no* great Use, when the sovereign Pro- *cess imported the fame Thing. Now a Piocefs might import a Command, and Letters conjuring a Compliance with it be sent, and be of great Efficacy, where the Execution of the Com- mand was to be doubted of, or might admit of a Demur.

Perhaps, the Editor might dislike the word conjuring here, be- cause the Cadence of the Verse requires that the Accent ihould lie upon the tepenultima; and the Sense, that it lhould lie upon the-Pernultima. To explain this Difference; when we in- tend by *o~jae, to signify a folerim Adjuration only, we lay the Accet upon the aft Sylable; where-e meam by it a magical tnocatiwo or Esef, the Accent falls upon the sirs. But our Poet uSes the Word in both these Senses promincuoufly, witl- out regard to this Difference in the Pronnciation; and, I be- lieve, generally, if not always, will be found to lay the Stress upon the irfl Syllable.

Had I never seen any other Edition of SHAKESPEARE than Mr. P!o PE'S, I could not but have fuftpe&ed Something wrong here, tho' I Ihould not, perhaps, have known so easily how,to
to retify it. Just before the Entrance of Opbelia, a Noise is heard behind the Scenes, vi<. of Some, that would ,have 'the Young Lady admitted; and of Others, that would keep her out. Laertes's Friends, as we may obferve.at the. Beginning,of the preceding Scene, where he rushes in by force .upon.,the King, are set to guard the Door; and they might be follici- tous that Laertes -hould fee his Sifter in her.Madnefs, to heighten his Refnenmets .for the Death of his Father.. .tBut it is certainly very absurd that Laertes should- kriow- vh6. it is withobt, upon the Noise made; that Ophelia ihould come.'in; and then that he {hould desire; -that She may come, in; and then after all, that he Ihould enquire into the Mean- ing of the Noise. I think, the second Folio Edition sets the whole Paflage right; and it seems to Me that it ought. to be correced as that Copy, and several Others, which come after, exhibit it with more Propriety thus;,It faill as level toyour Judgment-pierce, .

'Tis natural for Laertes, who was in a riotous Proceeding against the King, to be alarm'd at the Tumult wit0lout, leait his Party could not maintain the Door: And as soon as he fees the Occasion of the. Noise, in the Adriniffion of his dif- traded Sifter, his deep Concern makes him wvifl at once that he were depriv'd both of Sense and Sight. But why, blurn ON the Sense? This Reading, in Mr. Po P Es Impreflion, is, as I apprehend, a literal Mistake of the Press instead of burn O U T; and it is a Mistake so easy to happen, that I think in another Place the fame Error has passed thro' all the Editions of SHAKESPEARE ; and, as I suppose, was not so much as,fufpeded
fufpeted by our Editor, because he has given us the Passage as he found it.,In the WI NTER'S TALE , Floriel, Prince of Bohemia, in Oc(,,rji. a-paftoral Habit, addresses Perdita, an Outcast Princess of Sicily, Emc!dation. but supposed of mean Extraction; who was taken up an Infant, in a Defart of Bohemia, by a Shepherd, and educated as his Daughter. As the Prince is courting, carefling, and whispering her at a Sheep-fl1eering Feast, Polixenes his Father, and an old Courtier attending him, come to the rural En- tertainment. They fix their Eyes on the young amorous Cou- ple, and observing Something in the Virgin above her out- ward Seeming and Rank, fall to making these Observations on them. Polix.

This to me seems obscure even to the Degree of being unintelligible. The SPEC- TATOR, if I remember right, tells us somewhere a Story of a Climate so cold at one Season, that it congealed Words even in the Pronunciation; and so soon as a Thaw came, they were diftinaly repeated and heard: But, I must own, I never heard of any Words so condens'd as to be visible to the Eye, much less to the Blood.

I'll now give the Reasons for my being on this Side of the Question. Laertes is complaining, that (because the Kirig durst not prfue -Hamlet to Death for killing Polonius, but had only sent him out of the way;) he has loft a Father, and the Op- portunity of being reveng'd on his Murtherer. The King bids Laertes not break his Sleep about the Want of his Revenge; for, fays He, I v'id your Father, and I love my self; and both Thefe'are fy Motives to That End. But how did the King's'-ove of himself contribute to his Defre of Reienge on Hamlet'? sori theireii lies the Stress of the Alteration. Now there 'are twvo Speeches of the King in this very Scene, that perfwade -me to espouse,this
this Reading, and believe it preferable to That of the Editor: For the King fays expressly, that Hamlet had fought his Life too; and that He was not so unapprehenfive of Danger, as to be negligent in defending himself from it.

And whenever it is so pre- fixed, I don't know an Infiance either in our Poet, in SPENCER, or -in CHAUcER, that the compound Word signifies what the fim- ple.Word did before it was annexed. If I am not miitaken in this Observation, or it has not its particular Exceptions to which I am a Stranger, perhaps, we may with a very flight Change set our two Passages right.

SHAKESPEARE, where a Word, with the Particle un prefixed,to it, should seem to signify the fame Thing as the simple Word would do; and even there I. violently fufpe& the present Reading. It is in his King o Hrs, pag. 151. W here Lady CONSTANCE drvifes the Dau!plin of Firace not to sacrifice his Oath and Conscience to the Temptations of a'young fair Bride. Her Words are these;,Lewis, sia;:d faju ; the 'Devil tenpts tbee here Is Likerefs cf a ucw U N T R I M M E D Bride. I cannot conceive what the Poet is supposed to mean here by untrinm'd, unless its opposite, as I take it, in Sense, trim; i. e. neat, spruce, fine. But I cannot admit it, without fomeProof for Convicion, to carry that Signification. Again, there is no Room surely to imagine that the Poet intends to compare the Lady BLANCH, as unmarried, to a Vessel wanting either the Proportion ofher Ballast or Rigging, or not being comspleat in her Trim, as the Sea-phrafe is; and rherefore calls her untrimmed. This would be a remote Allitfon with a Vengeance; and, efpe. cially, when it is put in the Mouth of a Woman too.,As I profess my self to have fufpeaed thePaffage, so I en- deavour'd as far as an unsupported ConjeCure, or two, would go, to reconcile it to an intelligible Meaning. I fay, a Con- ieCure or two, for which I have no Warrant or Assistance from t rhe Copies ; and therefore I shall urge them barely as fich, c:::-a. and leave them to be embraced, or renounced, at Pleasure. If,it did not depart too widely from the present Text, to make such a Correction reasonable, it is not impoflble but the Poet might have wrote;,-------- tb: Te-vil tei;pts thee here In Lik;;cf;-cf a ccw UNTAMED Bride.,1. e.
i. e. a Virgin-Bride; a Bride yet unbedded. I cannot, indeed, re- collea any Instance, in which the Poet has ever taken the Li- berty of using this Epithet in that metaphorical Sense: But it is a Sense, in which I am sure he may be born out, andjutified, by the Usage of other Languages. An untamed Bride exadly a- mounts to what the Latines call'd Virgo indomita ; which I be. lieve they borrow'd from the 7ai, ros sgaw. of the Greeks; that is, a Bride untafled, nenjoy'd. And it will be no new Dodrine, to fay, that Temptation and Desire are generally heighten'd in Men by that Circumstance.,But I observe that trin is used as an Epithet by our Author, to signify not only neat, spruce, &c. but fuibfJantively too, for a peculiar Quaintness and Elegance of Habit. So in the Firfi Part of HENRr IV. pag. zoo.,IJVhen I was dry with Rage, and extrea0i Toil, Breathless and fain, leraiing upon my Sword, Came there a certain Lord, neat, T R I M L Y dres'd; Fresi as a Bridegroom, &c.

And he employs it besides to signify personal Beauty, and the Hue and Brightness of Colours. So in his Poem of VE N U s and ADo NIS, pag. 41.,jThe Flo:v'rs are fJ'eet, their Colours frejfq and TRIM, Biut true fJaeet Beauty liv', and dy'd ii Him. It is not improbable therefore, that the Passage before us ought s.&im(:o, - to be reftor'd thus; Jctlrc.,Lewis, fland fifi; the 7Devil tempts thee here In Likeness of a new B E T R I M M E D Bride.,S i.e.
i. e. adorn'd, and deck'd writh Charms. It is familiar with our Poet to use the word betrim in these Senses; and it is certain- ly of Saxon Derivation; among whom gettymmed signified neat, fine, finifJed, &c. The Transmutation of g into b was cuflo- mary in Words of Saxon Original; as gewarian, to beware; ge. lafain, to believe, &c. Of which Changes, thro' all the Letters of the Alphabet, SKINNIER has difcours'd at large in his Prole- gomena Etym ologica. i-' BBut if betrimmed may seem to any to depart too far from coj.-;. the Traces of the Test, as it now stands, I'll propose another,Correlion that requires but a very minute Change, and comes up to the Sense of the former; As,,Lewis, fland fait ; the 5Devil tempts thee here Is Likeness of a new A ND TRI M M ED Bride. i. e. of a nero Bride,. and one, as I said before, deck'd with all the Charms of personal Beauty.,I have hinted above, that I remember'd but a single Passage in our Author, where a Word, with the Particle un prefixed to i1, ihould seem to figniry the fame Thing as the simple Word would do: Bur I find lince, there are fame other Instances of this kind; One, at least, in which Sbakefpeare is countenanc'd by the Usage of other Writers: Some, in which his present Reading is certainly to be disputed, and therefore ought to be corrected. See King HzN-r VIII. pag. 487.,------- for where I'm robb'd and bound, There tnji I be unloos'd, src. 'Tis evident here, that unloos'd signifies loos'd; and so we find it used by other Writers. To go no farther for Authorities than theTranflation of our New Testament, there is a Passage where, in three of the Evangelifis, the Word unloos'd is made to mean loosed; -- WlofJeS1oe-laftchs I am not worthy to unloose, &c. This Term therefore, without any more ado, must be admitted,equivocal
equivocal in its Signification. But let us try our Author upon another doubtful Passage, and then I have done with this Re- mark. I observe he uses the Term, to bonnet, in the Sense of --- to pul off the Cap to. COSIOLANUS, pag. 130.,He hath deferv'd worthily of his Country; and his A/cent is not by,fitch eajy 'Degrecs as Those who have been fipple and courteous to the People, bonnetted without any ftrther 'Deed to heave them at all into their Ejimation and Report. i.e. that have won the People's Hearts, only by Submission, and pulling off the Hat to them. Now as bonnetted here ma- nifeilly Iignifies pulling off the Hat; so, on the other hand, if you can believe our Author's Text, unbonnetted is in another place employ'd to mean having the Hat on. OTHELLO, pag. 482.,-- - -..- I fetch Life and Being From Men of royal Siege; and my 'Demerits May speak, unbonnetted, to as proud a fortane, As This that I have reach'd. W\ill any Body pretend that the Idiom of our Tongue can admit unbonnetted here to intend, with the Hat on, as the Sense of the Place necessarily requires ? I cannot help faying with Ho- R AC E,,--------- Credat Yudaeus apella, Non ego. -------- Enimcdatiqn. In short, I dare affirm, the Press, or the Transcribers, have palm'd a Reading upon the Author contrary to his Intention. I am of Opinion, that, to bonnet, is equivocal, and lignifies, as the Context may require, either to pull of, or put on, the Hat; but that, to unbonnet, is always to pull it off. I make no Scruple, therefore, but that the Author wrote thus;,S2 ----I

I find, this Reading possesses several of the Editions, and even That of the accurate Mr. HrUGRS. I don't know upon what Authority it first obtain'd; but it seems evident to Me, who- ever introduced it, did not mind to expound the Author by himself; which is the surest Means of coming at the Truth of his Text. The second Folio Edition has it in both places.,A;'d in; the Ci;p an U N I ON S Iall he throw, Richer than That, &c. And so in the second Passage;,'Drink off this Potion ; Is thy U N I O N here ? Mr. Pope, indeed, takes Notice of this as a Various Reading, but in Both places fubtfitutes Onyx. I am clearly for the Union being reftor'd; and !hall submit my Reasons for it to Judg- ment. An Onyx, as we may find from PLI NY and the other Zt!traiifls, was a finall Stone-Gemm; and was likewise a coarser Species of h!cid Stone, of which they made both Co- lumns and Pavements for Ornament. An Union is a fine Sort of Pearles, so call'd, either because they are found single, or because they resemble an Onion in Shape, &c. But the Etymo- logy of the Name is of no Consequence here. I'll transcribe thle King's whole Speech, by which it will appear for what, and upon what Terms, he promises to throw a Jewel into the Cup; and after that Another short Speech, from which I believe it will be apparent, that Union ought to be reftor'd instead of O0yx.,Set ~.:e the Stcops of l'ine iopan that Table: If Hamlet gic te e firtf or second Hit, Or quit iin A'fe of the third Exchange, Let all the Battl;emrents their Ord'nance fire: -Te King Jba!. dri, ,e to Hamlet's better Breath; And in the Cp an Onyx ihall he throw,,Richer
Richer than That which folur flcceffive Kings In Denmark's Crown have worn. Well; Hamlet and Laertes immediately fall to play with the Foils; Hamlet gives Laertes the firfi Hit; and the King there- upon, in Performance of his Promise, fays;,Stay, give me D9rink: Hamlet, this PEARL, is thine; Here's to thy Health; give him the Cup. Now if an Union be a Species of Pearl, as it certainly is; and if an Onyx be a transparent Gemm, quite differing in its Na- ture from Pearls; the King faying that Hamlet has earn'd the Pearl, I think, amounts to a Demonitration, that it was an Union-pearl he meant to throw into the Cup; and that there- fore, as I said before, Union ought to be reftor'd into the Poet's Text; and Onyx cafheer'd as a spurious Reading. Besides, if I am not mistaken, neither the Onyx, nor Sardonyx, are Jewels, which ever found Place in an Imperial Crown.,XCVI. Ad 5. Scene 6. Page 470. .-----. Oh proud death !

I can fee no great Propriety here in this Epithet of eternal; nor does it communicate any Image suitable to the Circumstance of the Havock, that Fortinbras looks on, and would represent in a Light of Horror. He, upon the Sight of so many dead Bodies, exclaims against Death, as an execrable, riotous DePfroyer; and as preparing to make a favage'and hellish Feast. The Quarto Edition of 1637 seems to give us an Epithet more forcible, and peculiar to this Scene of Acion.,T .-..0

I meet with this Reading no where but in the fourth Folio Edition ; and in the Duodecimo publiih'd by MIr. To Nso , which does not much out-do the Other in Corretnefs. Surely, Fortiniras cannot be supposed to confider either himself, or Hamlet, here, as AEors before an Audience; and upon the Stage of a Theatre. The Poet must very firangely forget himself, to be guilty of such an Absurdity: But I dare fay, he may be clear'd from a Suspicion of it. In short, the Cafe is This: Hamlet, upon the Point of Death, conjures Ho- ratio, who was desirous to have poifon'd himself, to relinquish those Thoughts, and to live, and by a true Representation of Occurrences, rescue his Charater and Memory from Scandal. Page 460.,Oh, good Horatio, what a wounided Name, Things jfanding thus unknoIwn, fiall live behind MIe !

Horatio, in Obedience to this Command, desires Fortinbras will order, that the dead Bodies may be placed on a publick Stage, or Scaffold, and he will speak to the Business of their difaitrous Deaths.

THE APPEN D IX.,HE Examination of this tingle Play has drove out into such a Length, that I am almofi afraid to think of an Appendix to it. But I have tied my self down by express Engagement, at my setting out; and I am satisfied, unless an Author acquits himsel very badly, the Publick never care to bate him his Promifcs. I undertook, I think, boldly to prove, That, whatever Errors occurr'd in HAMtLET, Er- rors of the fame Sorts Ihould be found in the other Plays, through- out all the Volumes. 'Tis evident, the Fnults of that Play have bran- ched out into many C/asOes: And I have an ample Stock of Matter before Me, to make good my Assertion upon every individual Spece;. As tnis is but a pcimen, I nhall be crcufed from pointing out those innumerable literl, Faults of the Press, which every Reader can correc, that docs but throw his Eye over the Pafrages. As to the Faults of Pointirg too, I Ihall confine my self to remark on Such on- ly, in which the Scnfe is palpably injured; in which the Editor has followed the old printed Copies, and in which he has either not fcem'd to fufpet a Fault, or not underflood how to recify it. The Design of this Work was an honest Eudeavour to restore SHAKESPEARE ftom the Corruptions, that have taken Place in all his Editions: And, to this End, I gave it as my Opinion, that an Editor of Him, ought to be a Critick upon him too. The Want of Ori- ginals reduces us to a Necessity of gueDfing, in order to amend him; but these GuesTes change into Something of a more filbfitatial Nature, when they are tolerably supported by ReafGj or Authorities. There is certainly a Degree of Merit in a good Conjecture; tho' it be not Co thoroughly fatisfa&ory and convincing as the Party, who advances it, flatters him- self it mull be. This calls to my Mind a Sentiment in an oldLatin Verse, though I do not remember at present to what Author we owe it;,BenE qui conjiciet, Vatem hunc perhibcbo oqtiram. I am far from entertaining so vain an Hope, that every Conje&ure, which I have ventur'd to make, Lhall be followed with the Concurrence and Applause .of the Readers: But I may dare to aflcrt, Some of them are so well-grounded and certain, that They renew in Me a With, that Mr. POPE had proposed to himself to enter upon this Province. This would naturally have led him to weigh every Line of his Author with that Care and Judgment, that, I believe, Then he would have retraced some few of those Conjecures which he has made; and in which he seems to have err'd, either from Want of duly confidering the Poet, or of a competent Knowledge of the Stage. The Cause of SHAKESPEARE is here engaged, and the Restitution of Him concern'd; and therefore I mull beg Mr. POPE'S Par- don for contradiaing Some of his Conjeaures, in which he has mistaken the Meaning of,our
Ocr Author. No other Cause, but This, should provoke me to run so bold a Rifque; and if I have the ill Fortune to deceive my seif in the Attempt, I shall willingly submit to own my felt, (as HAMLET fays to L.ERTES, ) his Foil iir my Ignorance.,hne elceprionab!c Conje&ures of the Editor, I think, may be ranged under these Heads; as, where he hasf/,t-;:::sd a frecb Reai'ng, and there was no Occasion to depart from the Poet s Texc; whecre he has raimn'd the Author by an unadvis'd Degradation; where he has made a btd Choice in a Vsrious Reading, and degraded the better Word; and where he, by .ijftairsg the Gloss of any Word, has given a wrong Turn to the Poet's Sense and Meaning. Of the frfr Species of These I Ihall produce but a lingle InRlance because my Defence cf rhe Poer will take pn some Room: But, I am in hopes, the Novelty of the Subjet, and the Varie of the teMatter, will make it not appear too tedious.

But Mr. POPE,will have this to be One of thofepalable Bluders, wnich the Illiteracy of the firl Publilhers of his Works has fther'd upon the Poet's Memory, and is of Opinion that it could not be of onr Author's penning; i: no: bring at all credible, that there could be the Errors of any llr:a wh, bst.d she ti Tir.n're of a School, or the leaI Conterfation with firch as had.* 'Tis * Frs' ft. ~ for this Reason, and to shelter our Author from such an Absurdity, that the Editor has ex-,pun='d the Name of A.ISTOTLE, and fubifituted in its place graver Sages. But, with Sub- miÂ£on, even herein he has made at bell but half a Cure. If the Poet mull be fetter'd down fi'eiay to the Chronology of Things, it is every .whir as absurd for Helor, to talk of PHI- *Dio--mLi- LOSOPHY, as for him to talk of Arito:Ie. We have sufficient Proofs, t that Pythagoras was r-.- Ci- the firtr who invented the Word Pbilofopey, and cail'd himself Philosopher: And he was ceo. fr;-Ee- near 6o3 Years after the Date of Helor, even from his beginning to flourish. 'Tis true, r--- Poi- the Thing which we now onderiand by Philosophy, was then known; but it was only ca5; 'as- tiLt rte call'd Knsrwledge and Yfiif m. But to dismiss this Point; I believe this Anachro- c -:-,-t: n;i-frn of our Poet, (and, perhaps, all the Others that he is guilty of,) was the EfTec of Po- r: -"- elick Licence in him, rather than Ignorance. Ar?' ;--oi It has been very familiar with the Poets, of the Stage especially, upon a Supposition that f-r :" -o , their Audience were not so enxatly inform'd in Chronology, to anticipate the Mention of S"fie:'s .

SPEARE believ'd were ever heard of by that Roman. From his many Plays founded on our Engli/h Annals, and the many Points of History accurately tranfnitted down in them, I flppofe it mult be confefs'd that he was intimately versed in that Part of Reading: Yet, in his King LEAR, he has ventur'd to make t Edgar talk of the Curfew, a Thing not known 1t Pge 6, in Britain, tillthe Norman Invasion: In his King JOHN he above fitty times mentions Can- nons, tho' Gunpowder was not invented till above a Century and an half after thL Death of that Monarch; and what is yet more singular, (as he could not be a Stranger to the Date of a remarkable Man, who liv'd so near his own Time;) twice in the Story of Henry VI. he makes Mention of ASachiavel as a subtle Politician: Tho', 'is very well known, He was chief Counsellor to the wicked CJfar Borgia, and a Favourite to the Popes Leo X. and Clement VII. the latter of whom did not come to the Papal Chair till the ifth Year of K. Henry VIII. All these Transgressions in Time therefore, as I said before, are Liberties taken knowing- ly by the Poet; and not Absurdities flowing from his Ignorance. There is one Pafiage, I remember, in our Author, in which, if I am not mistaken, he may be prefum'd to sneer at his own Licentiousness in these Points. It is in'his LEAR: The King's Fool pronounces a fort of Dogrel Prophecy; and as soon as he has finilh'd it, cries, t This Prophecy Merlin Pra , S, jfall male; for I do live before his time. Nor have these Liberties been taken alone by SHAKESPEARE among our own Poets: In the Humoroets Lieutenant of BEAUMSONT and FLETCiHER, all the Characters of which Play are the immediate Successors of Alexander the Great: Dcemetrins, Prince of lacedon, comes out of his Chamber with a Pitol in his Hand, above isoo Years before Fire-drmis were ever thought of. So, in the Oedipris of DR'DEX and LEE, there is a Mention of the Aa- chines in the Theatre at Athens; tho' neither Plays, nor Theatres, were so much as known to the World till above soo Years after that Prince's Days. And yet I dare fay, neither Beaumont and Fletcher ever supposed, or thought to make their Audiences believe, that PiRols were used in Demetrins's Time; nor were DI9ydcn and Lee so ignorant in Dramati- cal Chronology, as to suppose 'ragedy of as early a Date as Oedipus. But that the Poets of our own Nation may be julified in these Liberties by Examples of the Antieuts, I'll throw in a few Instances of the like fort from their Predecellors in the Art at Greece. The Great SOPHOCLES, in his Elellra, supposes that Orefles was thrown from his Chariot, and kill'd, at the Pvythiai Games; which Games, as the Scholiall tells us, were not instituted till 600 Years afterwards by Triptioleiis. And frequent Inliances occur in Atheneus, that Ihew, beyond Exception, how tree the Comick Poets made with Chronology. ALEXIS in his Comedy call'd Hejione, introduces tlercules drinking out of a Tshericlean Cup: Nosw this was a Species of Cups, invented by Tbericles a Corintolian Pot- ter, who was Contemporary with Ariflophantes, above 80o Years after the Period of ller- cules. ANAXANDRIDES, in his PrroteAiltas, a Hero that was kill'd by Hetor, brings in Her- rules again, and talks of Iphicrates the Athenian General, and Cotys the T'hracian King, both living in the Poet's own Days. And DIPHILUS, 111 his Sappbho makes Arcilochus, and Hip- ponax, both address that poetical Lady, tho' the firfi was dead a Century before She was born; and tho' She was dead and rotten before the latter was born. If these Inftanccs of Transgression in Time may go any Way towards acquitting our Poet for the like Inconfiltencies, I'll at any Time engageto ftrengthcn them with ten t' imes the Number, fetch'd from the Writings of the belt Poets, ancient and modern, foreign and domellick. II. I come now to confider a 2Degraded Paffagc, by which I think we may safely affirm Degraded p.i,; the Poet's Sense to be maim'd. It may be very juRlly said of SHAKESPEARE'S Style, as He fge rcltord. himfelt fays of the Web of human Life, it is of a mingled Tarn, good and ill together. And therefore it mult be own'd, Mr. POPE has very often with great Judgment thrown out of the Text such low Tralh, as is unworthy of the Poet's Characer, and minll disgust a Read- er who is desirous to be pleased. But if unhappilyfome of his mean Conceits are so inter- mingled either with the Business, or the Sense of the Context, that they cannot be rejected without leaving an Imperfe"tion, there we must dispense with them; and content ourselves to be sorry for the Levity of the Author's eP;i, or the Iice of the Times that forc'd him to bring in such thaldlfitticifirs. Let us now examine the Editom's Rule in making these De- gradations. Some fnfpeled Paf;~iges, fays He, t vwich are exceJjiiely bad, (and 7which rfecmn . pal Interpolations, by being so inserted tb.at one can intirely omit them without any Chasm r. De- ficience ii the Conrtxt,) arc degraded t the Botoam of t:e Page; wvith an Asterisk referring,to
;. the 1; :es cf teir Irferl.is. I am afraid, all the degraded Passages are not thrown out with that due Care, but that there is left an actual Deficience in the Context for want of their Insertion. As for Example; In TROILUS and CRESSIDA, Page 87. Alteror the T'rojan, a Prisoner to the Greeks, be- ing agreed to be ezchang'd for Crefjida the Daughter of Calchas, Diomede is sent from the Greeks to bring her from Trov; and upon her Arrival at the Grecian Camp with him, file receives a Welcome from the Princes.,Agam.

If Dii:ede leads Cre/id off as the Poet certainly means he should, in order to deli- ver her up to her Father, 'tis plain, as the Sun at Noon-day, that Calcbas cannot be fuppo- led upon the Stage: His Name therefore mull be expung'd from among the Names of Those that are laid to enter. In the second Place, is it not very absurd for Siiomede to bring her on where so many Princes are present, and preparing to give her a Welcome, and then to lead her off abrupt- ly, so soon as ever Agarmeroer. has said a ingle Line to her? But it is still more absurd, when Crej is made to be led off without uttering one single Syllable, for NESTOR to observe, that She .: a Wom. of a:-,ck Serfe; as if she had siid several witty Things. The Truth is, in the old Copies, glanrr..sre, NesEor, Achilles, 'Palrocle, and Menelaus, all kifs Crelid; and, alter the Line at which the Aflerisk is plac'd, there follows the Quantity of a Page of Repartee betwixt :ilere.:ls, Patrocers, Ulles and Crefdid; in which Creflid bears her full Share. Indeed, the Matter of the Dialogue is but poor, and confilts of Conundrums and low Conceits; vet it contains so much Raillery on the Part of Cressid, that there is some Colourfor N.ft:r to fay, She is a lIorzan of qu.ick Sense. This Dialogue therefore, mean as i i, must be reftor'd, or Neiflr's Character of her l'it, from her faying Nothing, will be as extraordinary as the two Kings of Bren.ford hearing the Whisper, tho' they are not pre- sent, in the RELEARSAL. And, in the third Place, 'io;srede is said to lead out Cressid, and then return. Now, no Ie-nt,,y of him being mark'd in the Books, this Note, according to the Custom of the Stage, implies, that He only goes with Cressid to the Scene, and comes back immediately; bat it is intended that he should surrender her to her Father's Hand at his Tent; which, letit have been ever so near to that of Agraemron, muff take up some little Space of Time; and therefore, I think, it ought to be said only thus, ---- Exit Diomede, leading Crefdida: --- and that, immediately before this Verse in Page 89.,Again. Here is Sir Diomede: Go, gentle Knight; &c. the Re-entry of Si-med: ought to be mark'd: For thus above Thirty Verses are allowed for the Interval of his Absence; and the Beginning of Agarnemrnons Speech seems to inti- mate that DiPsmie comes back, and joins them, at the very Intant heis uttering his Words.,111. But
III. But if (as in marking the Entrance of Calhas, when he ought not to be brought on ) Mr. POPE has err'd once by following all the printed Copies, I'll produce another Infance from the fame Play, in which, I think, he is as plainly mistaken by departing from the whole Set of Editions.,TROILUS and CRESSIDA, Page 12.,Pand. Good morrov,' colnin Creflid: lz7at do you talk of * How do you, Colrnn?,When werd you at Ilium? * Gd morrow lexander, is added in all the Editions very abfirdy, PAsIS not being,on.the Stage. This is the Note Mr. POPE has fubjoin'd as his Reason for throwing tho/e Words out of the Text. I confers, I want a better Reason, before I can think of following the Editor's private Opinion, in this Cafe, againfl the Authority of all the Impreflions. I am very well persuaded, notwithstanding Parts is not on the Stage, there is no such Absurdity as Mr. Pope has suspeCted, but that the Words, Good tmorrow, Alexander, ---- ought to be honeflly re- flor'd to the Poet's Text. In short, before the Entrance of Pandarns, Crelid and her Man are upon the Stage together, discoursing about Hetor's Resentment againfl Ajax, and for what Cause. And why might not Alexander be the Name of Crefid's Man? Paris had no Patent, I suppose, for engrossing the Name to himself. Besides, Pandarus being of a busy, fiddling, insinuating Charaser, 'tis natural for him, as soon as he has given his Cou- fin the good Morrow, to pay his Civilities too to her Attendant. And to this I'll add an- other Observation, which falls out very unluckily for the Editor's Remark; that tho' Paris is, for the Generality in HOMER call'd ALEXANDER, yet, in this Play of our Author, by any one of the Characers introduced, he is call'd Nothing but PARIS. I gave the Play a frelh Reading all through, on Pnrpofe to confirm my self in this Observation: And it con- vinces me that, by Alexander, the Poet here intended Crffid's Man. Reltore the Paflage therefore, as all the Editions before read it;,Pand. Good morrow, Cofin Creflid: What do you talk of? Good morrow, Alex-,ander; ---. How do yo, Con/in? h'ben were you at Ilium ? IV. I'll now proceed to confider a Conje&ure of the Editor's, which I am very free to Conjeiure re- own is ingeniously urg'd: But there is Something more than Ingenuity requir'd, to guess for soed. the Stage rightly. His Conie'ture is grounded upon a marginal Interpolation, that had crept into the Text of some later Editions, in Dame Quikly's admirable Description of the Man- ner in which Falfjaffe dy'd.,K. HENRY V. Page421.,For after I saw him fumble with the Sheets, and play with Flowers, and,smile upon his Finger's End, I knew there war but one way; for his nose was asjlasrp as a Pen. * His nose was as iharp as a pen, and a table of green fields. h"bef Words, and a table of green fields, are not to be found in the old Editions of 16oo aRn 1608. 7/hi nonfrnc got into all thefollowing Editions by a pleasant mistake of the Stage-Edi- tors, who printed from the common piece-meal written 'arts in the Play-houaf. A Table was here direted to be brought in, (it being afcene in a tavern where they drink at parting,) and this Direlion crept into the text from the margin. Greenfield was the name of the Property-man in that time who fumih'd implements, &. for the afors. A Table of Greenfield's. So far, the Note of the EDITOR. Something more than Ingenuity is wanting, as I said before, to make these ConjeFures pass current; and That is, a competent Knowledge of the Stage and its Cuoms. As to the Hiltory of Greenfield being then Property-Man, whether it was really so, or it be only a gratis dilurm, is a Point which I thall nor contend about. But allowing the marginal Direcion, and supposing that a 'able of Greenfield's was want- ing; I pofitivcly deny that it ever was cultomary (or, that there can be any Occalion for it),U either
ei!-:r in the Prer,:-;r's Book, or piece-meal Parts, where any such Dire&ions are'marginally inferred for the Pr:,erties, or l:.?le'r.:s wanted, to add the Property-Man's Name whole Businers ir was to provide them. The Stage-Neceffaries are always furnifh'd between.the ar.resi-. M mand the Srr:-Kerpsr; and as the Direction is for the Promptor's Use, and if- ie fr om him, there can b no Occaion, as I said, for inferring the Names either of the o:e, or the other. But there is a flonper Obje&ion yet againfl this Conjeaure of the Editor's, in the Man- ner he fupofes i;: W hich he must have tbrefeen, had he had that Acquaintauce with Stage- Bo7:.s, which it has been my Fortune to have. Surely, Mr. POPE cannot imagine, that when Implernen- are wanted in any Scene, the Direfion for them is mark'd in the Mid- dle of that Scne, tho' the Things are to be got ready againll the Beginning of it. No; the Diretions for Erra:ces, and Prworr:ics wanting, are always mark'd in the Book at about a Page in Quantity before the Adsrs quoted are to enter, or the Properties be carried on. And therefore Ge^ixmtELDa's Table can be of no Use rorus for this Scene. 1 gree,indeed,wih Mr. Pope, that there Words might bea Stage-DireAion,and so crept into tie ' eat from the Margin: But, I inlil, that they mufl be a Dire&ion then for the fabfrcuuet Scene, and not for the Scene in ASian. I don't care therefore if I venture my Conjecture too upon the Pafsfge: I'll be fare at leafl, if it be not altogether right, it Ihall not be liable to the sltijd:ty of the ObjeiSsx lai fltruck at. I suppose, with the Editor, that over-againft the Words of the Text, there might be this Marginal Quotation so close to them, that the Ignorance of the Stage-Editors might ealily give them Admittance into the Text.,-.---..-- Nbi A'Jfe s cjbrp as a Chairs, and a Table off. Green perp. Fields. The Scene in Aaion is part of Dame Qicml , the Holtef, her House; and Chairs and Table ere here neceffiry: The following Scene carries us into the French Dominions. I therefore believe This was intended as a Direcion to the Scene-Keepers, to be ready to re- move the Cbas.:r and 7able so soon as the Adors went off; and to shift the Scene, from the TaSrrn, to a Profped of green Felds, representing Part of the French Territories. But what if it should be thought proper to retrac bath Mr. POPE's and my own Conjec- tre, and to allow that these Words, corrupt as they now are, might have belong'd to the Poet's Text? I have an Edition of Sbarefpsre by Me with some Marginal Conjeciures of a Gentleman sometime deceas'd, and he is of the Mind to correa this Paifage thus;,for bis Nfe: o'as asjbrp as a Pen, and a' talked of green Fields. It is certainly obfervabie of People near Death, when they are delirious by a Fever, that they rtal of moving; as it is of Those in a Calenture, that they have their Heads run on green Fields. The Variation from Table to talked is not of a very great Latitude; tho' we may f.1 come nearer to the Traces of the Letters, by restoring it thus;,..--- fir :s Nrcf ias a jbarp as a Pen, and a: babied of green Fields. To bI ., or bat-l, is to mutter, or speak indircriminately, like Children that cannot yet talk, or dying Persons when they are losing the Use of Speech. Fa=:, r? V. Thenext Conje&nre, which I shall produce of the Editors, is likewise upon a cor- ? *_ rzsiedss PSige of the Author; but I am afraid his attempt to cure it is questionable for more,than one Reason.,Frfi Part f HEI .Y IV.

I mull own, I am at a Loss about this Conjecture of Mr. POPE'S. GadhIil, the Highwayman, is here boafling to the Chamberlain of'the Inn, that he is in no Fear of hanging; becaufec le is not link'd with a Gang of common little Rogues, but countenanced and born but in his Occupation by the Society of Persons of great Rank; alluding, to Prince Henty's folne- times joining with them in their Robberies. But the Prince was no Trsftee or Cormifioner; nor had they any such link'd with them in their Gang, as I can find any where hinted by the Poet. Nor can I, indeed, conceive how Oneraire comes to signify (or, by Whom bcfidec the Editor it is so interpreted) Truflees or Commiifioers. The Word is apparenltly of Frecrb Termination; and imul have its Derivation from Onus of the Latine: And accordingly the French fay NeJs oneraires, to lignifyShips of Btrthen,for Carriage, &c. and it is always an Ad- jedtive, and is only used, as I know, In those Senses. There is another French Word, which I think would have much more nearly serv'd Mr. POPE's Purpose,. tho' not' have amounted direfcly to his Gloss; and that is, honoraires, i. e. honourable Persons, Persons worthy of honour; and so Cheviliers honoraires, we find, were Such as'were Khights by the Pririledge of their Birth, and not in the Right of any Order. But I am of Opinion that not even this Word rellores us the Poets Text. For supposing SHAKESPEARE himself acquainted with the Meaning of the Term, honoraire; we have noReafon to think he would have put it in the Mouth of so mean a fellow as Gadjhil: No other Part of his Diale& favours of so much Politeness, or Knowledge in Language. If I may interpose my Conje&ure, I believe the Poet's Word here was One much more vulgarly known, and adopted familiarly into our Tongue; and besides, not greatly differing in the literal Part, and much less in the Sound, from the present corrupted Reading. I can't help suspecting that he wrote,,--.-.---- but with Nobility and ltranquillity; Burgomallers, cnd great SEIGNIORS, &c. As have expreft my self desirous, as often as may be, to expound the Author by himself, I espouse this my Conje&ure with the more Willingness, because I find him coupling the fame Terms in another of his Plays. See,,lerchant of VENICE. Page -.,2oar Miodis tofling on the Ocean, '.ere, where your Argofies with portly Sail, Like SEIGNIORS and rich BURGHERS on the Flood, &c. VI. i'll next proceed to examinea few PafTages, in which, as I conceive, Mr. POPE has varioin Rtid- adopted a Various Reading for the worse, and rejeced the better Term. So, in ingdifputedan d,supplicd. CYtBELINE, Page 197.,---------- Ido note, flhat Grief and Patience, rooted in him Both, Mingle their * POW'RS together.,* Spurs. I mull own, I cannot tell for what Reason, unless he did not remember the Signification of the Term, Mr. POPE has degraded Spurs here, and fubflituted Powers in its Place. I am sure, there is much greater Consonancy of the Metaphors, in rooted and Spurs; than.in rooted and Powers. For Spurs do nor only signify those sharp Irons which we wear at our Heels to make a Horse mend his Pace; and those horny Subllances upon a Cock's Legs, with which he wounds his Antagonist in fighting; but likewise the Fibres, or Strings, which shoot out from the Roots of rP7ants and Trees, and give them a Fixure and Firmness in the Earth. Neither Skinner, Cotgrav, nor Baily, remember to mention the Word in this Sense; but SHAKESPEARE knew the Propriety of the Term, and, as Mr. POPE might have observed, has used it in this Signification in his very firR Play.,U X The

XIV. I shall now address my self to confider a few of the Editor's Gloss, in which he AlifakenGlofi has either miflakeu the Meaning of the Words he would explain, or, where they are epuieo- and Emendat:. cal, has taken the wrong Interpretation to the Prejudice of the Author's Sense. on.

I cannot find it ever so interpreted: But granting it should be ever used in that Ac-,ceptation
Ceptation, I dare afirm that neither the Word itself, nor its Gloss, ought to have a Place here. Why fhonld one lan's speaking foolilhly be prefum'd to datnt another's Ears ? The D:lcourfe of a Fool naturally makes us laugh at, or deepife him, but does not, as I conceive, put a Damp upon our Spirits. I cannot but wonder the Editor did not trace the Author's Thouagt in this Place, as it is evident he did not, both by the Text, and Gloss upon it; but it leaves me th- Pleasure of explaining, beyond Exception, a Passage, which this ingenious Gentleman did not so much as guess at. Upon the first Reading, I immediately furpected it should be reftor'd, as I since find the fourth folio Edition, and lome other more modern Ones, happen to exhibit it;,------------- who, m very fere If T'ey Jossldfpseak, would aimoft DIAMN t}ofe Ears, 'bichb, b easrig t6he, woud call their Brothers Fools. The Author's Meaning is direcly this; That some People are thought wife, whilst they keep Silence; who, when they open their Mouths, are uIch tiupid Praters, that their Hearers can- not help calling them fals, and so incur the Judgment denounced upon them in the Gospel. It is very familiar with Sbakefipea- to allude to PafTages of Scripture; and it is plain to me, even to Demonfiration, that he had here before his Eye this Text of St. MATTHEW, Ch.

'Tis true, in BAILY'S Dictionary, we are told that Cheverillius was an old Latine Word for a Cockling, or young Cock. I don't know from what Authority he fays This; for neither Calepine, Ste- vens, Vfirrs, Martinius, Decimator, Buchner, (the old Glossaries, nor the modern Dictio- naries that I have look'd into,) take any Notice of. such a Word. And to this I'll produce a third Pailage from our Author, which I presume will make it evident beyond a Doubt, that Cheveril muit have a different Derivation. TWELFTH-NIGHT.

'c!: L.lr. XVII. This Appendix infenibly frretches out to such a Compass, that I mull be obliged,to aiS- over from mifaaen GiShsi, to Faults of other Kinds. I shall produce one more, how- ever, which is made upon a Word of a double Signification, and where the Editor has hap- pen'd to take it in a Sense, which I believe is very contrary to the Poet's Intention.

But I appeal to every One that (hall but read the Scene over, whether This could pofibly be the Poet's Meaning. There is a perfec Fray bentwit Doland Psilsl; She calls him an hundred the worit Names She can think of; He threatensto mnrther her Ruff, and flys, He could tear her: Bardolfe would have him begone; bat He Lays, he'll fee her damn'd firit: and Dl, on the other Hand, wants him to be thrult down Stas, and fays, She cannot endure such a Fustian Rascal. I should very little ex- per that these Parties, in such a Ferment, frould come to kissing: And Iam persuaded SHAKE- SP-EAR thought of no Reconciliation: For the Brawl is kept on, till it rites to drawing Swords; and Piflsl, among 'em, is huntled down Stairs. I cnnot think any more is intended by the Poet than This; that Falflaffe, weary of Pif- ics wrangling, tells him He would be quiet; and that Piflol, who had no Quarrel with Sir Jctr bat a Sort of Deperdance on him, speaks the Knight fair and tells him, that he ' s: Ray .l this Fill; for so, it seems, the Word Neif likewise finifies. * I wonder Mr. POPE did me- SC ue not remember This, when the fame Word (with a small Variation in the Orthography) had r=: cLr-.

For Want of t'is Caution and Guard, I believe, I can name a signal Inttance, in which Mr. POPE has sus- fer'd himself to be dereiv'd in his Translation of HOMER. In the Et:.b. Book of the ILIAD, just as Teeter has drawn his Arrow to the Head, and is going to let it fy, HIedr discharges a large Stone at him, which both prevents its Flight, and dciibies the Archer:,------- riS' c-- ; A.;; e -,E ?

Ejfiathili, Spnafiimn, Barms, and all the learned World, concurred in a diffcrent Con- itrution of the Palfage, viz. that HeSTor with the Stone broke Tecr's Bowlvlring, and numb'd his Hand violently into the Bargain. And, indeed, when I firlt read Mr. POPE's Translation, I imagin'd that by a Poetical Licence he had call'd the Bowflring the 7Tedon , as in another Place he takes the Liberty to call it the rerve: But his Note, filbjois'd to Lhew that HeCor firuck Teucer jull about the Articulation of the Arm with the Shoulder, which cut the T7endon, or wounded it so, that it loft its Force, foon.convinced me that the Tran- flator had mistaken the Meaning of his Original.

It is plain in the firlt Passage Mr. POPE underltands n,;oV in the Sense ofv,_psr or the Nerve of the Body. I cannot remember that it is ever employ'd in that Signification by any Author whatsoever: But This I know well and can aflure Mr. POPE, if he has not yet obferv'd it, that, as often as HOMER has used vfusi| either in the Iliad or Od)eity, it fignifiei in Him nothing but a Bouwfring. This is a Digreflion from the Btjinefs of SHAKXPEARE, but One that a Sameness of Er- ror naturally introduc'd; and I hope it will be pardolable, as it sets right a Passage, in which Many may be mifed by the Authority of the Translator's N ame. XVIII. I Ihall now proceed to give a Specimen of some few Passages, in which the point- Bad Poi.rtigs ing is so unfufferably bad, that the Poet's Sense is not only maim'd, but quite Rliled. And recatie3. yet as the Editor in These has follow'd the Pattern set him in the old Editions, the Continu- ation of Error cannot be supposed thro' Negligence, but because he would not please either to fufpec a Fault, or to indulge his private Sense in curing it. There are so many signal Blots of this Sort left, that, to point at them all, would be to extend this Work totenTimcs the Compass it has already taken up: I (hall therefore only cull out such a Parcel, as may demonstrate how far SHAKESPEARE wants reloring in this Particular. TROILUS and CRESSIDA, Page 74.,lEne. And thou jhalt bunt a Lion that will flit,With his Face back in human gentleness: Welcome to Troy --- Now, by Anchises' Life5 WelfYeoe indeed ---,X Thus
Thus this Pait'ge has all along been read, and never understood, as I suppose, by any of the Editors. Th.e iecond and fourth S51:o Editions make a small Variation of the Pointing, but do not at all mend the Matter. I don't know what Conception the Editors have had to them- feives of a L.:;'s frli:g ir: :reiare Gei;tler.es: To MIe, I confess, it seems Itrange Stuff. If a Lion nfy with his Face turn'd backward, it is fighting all the Way in his Retreat: And in this Manner it is LAesJ profefles that He hall fly, when he's hunted. But where then mre mie Srmptoms of hn :atre Ger.:lSenf? Mr. DRYDEN, in his Alteration of this Play from S-A EsE .RiE, has aited with great Ciauion upon this Passage: For not giving himself the Trouble to trac e tre Ahor's Ieaning, or to recify the Mistake of his Editors, he closes t:s Senrence at --- .::b 5 is Jfe backi.l ard; and entirely leaves out, in bhuanne Gentlenefl. In irt, the Place is fiat Nonsense as it flands, only tor Want of true Pointing.

This Correction, which I have here made, flight as it is, not only refiorcs good Sense, but admirably keeps up the Charaaer which nei had before given to Agan:,r.rn of his Trojan Nation, Page -7.,Ca:irriers a frce, as dbie:;r, :nn;rm'd, As benir.g Argels; tba's tbher Famne in peace: Bz *hetr. they x:s:d freor SoLiers, they haze Galls, Gasd Arons, firosg JCits, true Swords, and Jove's Accord, _sosr:hi.fjo:!l of Heart. ...c'..r- Tnis Quotation obliges me to make a short Stop, to set right the latter Part of this Pas- rt-t.';-. fae; whose Sense is likewrife bad, thro' a small Defect in the Pointing. Can the Poet be,fuApofed tO meanth tth he roaes had Joz;e's Accord, whenever they would seem Soldiers? Na; ce.tainly he would intimate, that Nothing was so full of Heart as They, when that God did bat ftfew himself on their Side. This Circumilance added, brings no Impeachment to thir Courage: Valour would become Presumption aud Impiety in them, if they trulted to it, when j7oe manifeflly declared himself on the other Side. It ought to be pointed and nnierflood thus;,Bt -bher They -ase:ld frei Soldaers, they have Galls, God Arnms, firos.g Jints, tree Swords; and, Jove's Accord, Nothi,.g f f,nll of Heart. i. e. y.:'s Accord, and Concurrence, seconding them, Nothinig so full of Heart as They. ., L3e. .XIX.

Mr. DENNIS, who has alter'd this Play, was obliged, by a different Difpolition of the Fable, to leave out this Passage, otherwise, 1 am persuaded there would have been no Room for my making a Correcion upon it.

X-XX. I muil no-w pass over to another Species of Errors, not infrequent in this Edition,,- which I cnnot otherwise diliinguif than by the Title of Transpositions; that is, either,where the Verses are so transposed and taken to Pieces, -that the Numbers are unnecessarily disjointed; where wrong Names have been prefix'd to the Parties speaking, or Parts of Sen- tences p!ac'd to one Speaker, that ought to belong to the Person answering; or where Stage- Direfaions are either mifphlc'd, or erroneously adopted into the Text.

Hortenfio is jealous that Lucentio is, li-e himself, aLover in Disguise, and Lfas he'll watch Him.

Alexas brings a Fortune-Teller to Iras and Char- mian, Cleopatra's Women, and fays himself, 'We'll know all our Fortuner. Well; the Snoth- fiyer begins with the Women, and some Joakes pals upon the Subje& of Husbands and ChaRtity; after which, as I apprehend, the Women hoping for the Satisfa&ion of having Something to laugh at in Alexas's Fortune, call to him to hold out his Hand, and wish hearti- ly he may have the Prognoltication of Cuckoldom upon him: ReRore therefore the Pas- rage:,Char.

The EDITOR has complain'd in his Preface, Page IS. that, often in the old Stage-Direci- Impressions, the Notes of fDiretion to the Property-Men for their Mloveables, and to the on crerp ir.i Players for their Entries, are inserted into the Text, thro' the Ignorance of the Transcribers. the Tex. I am afraid, he has not taken Care to remove all these wrong Insertions; and I believe the Inilance I am about to subjoin will be determined One of Those which ought not to have efcap'd his Observation.

But in abefieg'd Town, is it ever cuRfomary to order an Alarum, or Sally, by the ringing of a Bell? Or rather is not this Business always done by Beat of Drum? Hieronymus Magiur, I know, in an accurate and scarce Tra& of his upon the Antiquity and various Use of BELLS, speaks, among the rel, of a Tintirnabilulam Catrenre, or Great Bell used in Camps.

The Editor (who tells us, that in the oldelt Folio Edition, where the Ars and Diviiion of w. Scenes are sirs diftinguilh'd, they were divided according as they play'd them, often where Aet mif.ilkc. there was no Pause in the Ation, or where they thought fit to makeaBreach in it) has some- times taken Care to regulate the Shtufflirgs and 7ra.fpofitions of the Scenes, and relify the injudicious Divilions of the All: But this Part of Criticifnl does not display irfelf thro' the whole Work. I flall rubjoin one Pafiage, for Example, in which he flems to have em- ploy'd none of this Skill in marking the Division of an All, viz. the End of the Second A'l of King JoHN, Page I4f. 'Tis true, he errs here in following the old Copies; as he did, in the lall Instance but one, by contraditing them. The Lady CoiiJlcnrc, her Son Ar- thrr, and Lord Salisbury, are upon the Scene; Cofolance bids Salisbuory be gone, and leave her to her Woes: He tellsher, he mult not go without her to the two Kings of England and France. She absolutely refuses to go with him; fays, her Sorrow flall keep its State, and the Kings may come to it. Her concluding Lines are these;,---.---- For my Grief's so great, That no Supporter, but the huge firm Earth, Can hold it up. Here -- I anid orrow fit; Here -- is ry 'hrone; bid Kings rome bow to it. It is evident, I think, beyond Contradifion, that Conflantia here, in her Despair, feats her self upon the Floor of the Stage: And can the be supposed immediately to rife again, on- ly to go off and end the A& decently ? And if file does not, how can the Ac end here? There is but one other Method for it; and that is, of the foremoltfliat-fcene Ihutting her in from the Sight of the Audience, an Absurdity never once pralifed by SHAKESPEARE. In the very next Scene which follows, and fiands as thefirfl Scene of the third Ac, the Kings are introduc'd,.and Conflantia is likewise upon the Stage, and speaks within eight Lines of the Scene's beginning. We must therefore either suppose an Unity of the two Scenes, and that They come in to her so soon as hie fits down on the Floor; or rather, (which I think has been an Opinion of long Standing,) that an intermediate Scene or two have been loft, whereby we cannot now be certain how the A& ended; and that an Hiatus in Iinrfcripto ought to be mark'd to signify the Imperfeaion. XL. The faulty Passages which I have hitherto alledged, I think, are moRly such, as cal led for the AffilRance of JRdgmsent to let them right: There are other Places again, which are Fts orl I7; corrupted in our Author, that are to be cur'd by a firic Attention to the Author hilmfelf, rt and by taking Hil/ory along with us, wherever his Subjec is hiflorical. Diligence in this RefpeC& is certainly the Duty of an Editor: And yet that a due Care, even in this Part, has been hitherto wanting, the Inltances I am now going to subjoin will manifeltly prove. MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM, Page 9S.,Didft 71ou not lead him thro' the glrmm'riig Night From PEREGENIA, whom he ravisied? Mr. POPE confesses in his Preface, * that No one is more a Mafler of the Poetical Stors, Gr has more frequent Allusions to the variours Parts of it than SHAKESPEARE. It mudl be osn'd * p.ge a. and the Pafage before us is a signal Inflance. He touches upon a minute Circufltlaice in the Story of Thefens; but, indeed, None of the old Clafficks tell us of such a Person as Peregema, with whom that Hero had an Affair: Rellore therefore the Place, from the Au- thority of the Greek Writers.,Dilf thou not lead him thro' the glimmm'ring Night From PERIGUNE, whom he ravijhed?,Here

The former of Them adds, (as Diodo- rus Sls, 4;lid;r:s, and Pa:f:;i.u, likewise tell us,) that he kill'd her Father into the Bargain. .'e L:ie. XLI. K.

Henry, ana GLOUCESTER, with Prisoners, &c. But may it not be said, that Bourboni is brought in here amongst the French Prisoners ? To This, I reply, that our Poet would hardly have introduc'd a Characer of that Dignity, crowd- ed him amongst the common Prisoners, and neither made him speak to the King, nor the King to him. Besides, I have another Exception yet ftrongcr to add, why Bourbon cannot be supposed to enter here: In a few Pages after, (viz. Page 481.) the King asks the Duke of Exeter (who enter'd with him, and had been all along in the Presence) what Prisoners of Rank were taken, and Exeter replies;,Charles 2)ke of Orleans, Nephew to the King; John Duoke of BOURBON, and Lord Bouchiquald. I submit it therefore to the most common judgments, whether 'tis probable, if Bourbon was among the Prisoners introduc'd in the King's Train, that the Duke of Exeter could have been guilty of such an Absurdity, to tell the King that Bmrrbon was taken Prisoner.

He fled with the Earl of Pembroke into Betagny in K. Edward IVth's Reign: And many Artifices were tried both by That King firh and K. Richard afterwards, to get him deliver'd up by the French King, and Duke of Breta.avn But he happily efcap'd all the Snares laid for him. hBut during the greatell Part of his R1e idence abroad, he was watch'd and rellraiu'd almost like a Captive, and fsubied by Supplies convey'd from the Countess Dowager of Richmond, his Mother: Reflore therefore the Poet thus;,And who doth lead them but a paltry Fellow, Long kept in Bretagne at HIS Iother's Cofi?

I am obliged to give here a fr.ort Account of the Plot depending, that the Emendation, which I am about to make, may appear the more clear and unquestionable. The Business flands thus: Clas:!a, a Favourite of the Arragon Prince, is, by his Intercessions with her Father, to be married to the fhir Hero; Do: Jobn, a natural Brother of the Prince, and a Hater of Clas o3, is in his Spleen zealous to disappoint the Match. Borachio, a rascally Dependant on Don: Jobt, offers his Aifitance, and engages to break off the Marriage by this Stratagem. ' Tell the Prince and Cla:'.i (Jiss He) that Hero is in Love with Mie, they won't believe ' ir; ofer them Proofs, as that riey shall fee me converse with her in her Chamber Win- "cow: I am in the good Graces of her Wairing-Wuman Alargaret; and I'll prevail with ' i ALrare: at a dead Hour of Night, to personate her Aillrefs Hero ; do you then bring ' the Prince and Cl:iL to o er-hear our Discourse, and they fball have the Torment to " hrr ,e address lLrgaret by the Name of Hero, and her fay sweet Things to me by the Name of ClaEss." ---- This is the Subilance of Borachio's Device to make Hero sus- ercaed of Disloyalty, and to break off her Match with Cla4dio. But, in the Name of Gooniefs, could it difple-fe Cl:ud: to hear his Miiftres making Use of hi Name tenderly ? I he aw another hMan with her, and heard her call him Claudio, he might reasonably think her rrra-y'd, but not have the fame Reason to accuse her of Disloyalty. Besides, how could hr nanmi g Cl;as:o, make the Prince and Caudio. believe that she lov'd Borachio, as He de- ires Dxon ojn to insinuate to them that She did. The Circumflances confider'd, I have no D:ou; but the Passage ought to he corre&ed thus; Borach.

LI. But it is high Time now that I turn my Pen to one promised Part of my Task, E.icSDATIose which is yet in Arrears, viz. an Endeavour to restore Senlf to PafTages, in which, thiro' the Corruption of successive Editions, no Sense has hitherto been found: Or to rellore, to the belt of my Power, the Poet's true Text, where I lufpec it to be millaken thro' the Error of the Press or the Mannsfcripts. The utmoRl Liberty that I flall take in this Attempt, ihall ge- nerally confine it felt to the minute Alteration of a single Letter or two: An Indulgence which, I hope, I cannot fear being granted me, if It retrieves Sense to such Places as have either escaped Observation, or never been disputed or underRfood by their Editors. I'll dif- patch this remaining Part of my Appendix with all the Brevity that the Nature of the EsE.s- DATIONS will admit; as Such, they are humbly propos'd: But wherever better Judges are pleased to think that Word too peremptory, I am very well content to soften it into CON- JECTURES.

Portia here discoursing with her Waiting-Woman about her Suitors, Arerija runs over the Catalogue of them, with Design to found the Affedtions of her Lady. But how does talk- ing of Horses, or knowing how to shoe them, make a Man e'er the more a Colt? Or why, if a Smith and a Lady of Figure were to have an Affair together, should a Colt be the Issue of that Conjuntion? I make no Doubt but this is simply Portia's Meaning: Wlhat do you tell me of the Neapolitan CPrince? he is fitch a fJlupid l2fnce, that injfead of Jafying fine Things to me, he does Nothing but talk of his Horses. ---- Now; This is some Reason for sus- pe ing that his Mother fliould have play'd false with a Saith: People generally talk molt in their own Profeflions, or in Those of their Family; and Farriers, I presume, will be al- lowed to talk more of Horfemanlhipthan any other Subject.

Tho' the whole Set of Editions concur in this Reading, and it has pass'd wholly unfurpea- ed by the Learned Editor, I am very well affur'd, and I dare fay the Readers will be so too non. tht it is corrupt at Bottom. Let us look into the Poet's Sentiment, and the Hiflory' of the Persons ererecnted. If Hercules (fays he) and Licbas (for so is his Name to be relt, if we may take Spscles, Oi.-d, &c. for our Guides) were to play at Dice for the Decision cf their Superiority; Lisckr , the weaker Man, might have the better Carl of the Two. But how then is A,'i:des beaten by his Rage ? To admit This, we mult suppose a Gap in -th Poet; and that some Lines are loft in whiich l:recles, in his Passion for losing the Hand, had thrown the Box and Dice away, and knock'd his own Head against the Wall for meer Madnef. Thus, indeed, might he be said, in feme Sense, to be beaten by his Rage. But SE..3Esp AtRE had no such Stuff in his Head. He means no more than, if Lirbs had t;- b'eter Throw, so might Hercrles himself be beaten by Lichas. In short, Lichas was tho poor unfortunate Servant of Here:ses, who, unknowingly brought his Mafler the envc- nom'd Shirt. dipp'd in the Bloctd of the Centaur Aei.ies, and was thrown headlong into the Se for his Pains. The Poet has alluded to some Parts of this Fable in another of his Plays; and there indeed a reasonable Intimation is made of Hercules worsting himself thro' his own Rage.

It is scarce requilite to hint here, it is a Point so well known, that Page has been always used in Engll/h to signify any Boy-Servant; as well as what latter Times have appropriated the Word to, a Lady's Train-Bearer. And so Faljfaffe's Boy, in our Poet, is frequently cal- led his Page. So much in Explanation of this new-adopted Reading. The very excellent Lord LANSDOWNE, in his Alteration of this Play, tho' he might not sand to make the Cor- retion upon the Poet, seems at least to have underflood the Paflage exaaly as 1 do: And tho' he changes the Verse, retains the Sense of it in this Manner;,So were a Giant worfled by a Dwarf! Tho' I had made the Emendation, before I thought to look into his Lord/lip's Performance, it is no small Satisfaction to me, that I have the Authority of such a Genius to back my Con- jedture. LIV.

Bass Tes, here I tender it for him in the Court,,Tea, twice the Sum; if that will notj ffire, I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er, Onforfeit of my hands, my head, my heart. If this will not ffirce, it mufi appear That malice bears down TRUTH. ---- This is a Passage which has ever pass'd unfufpreed, and yet, I dare fay, does not yield us the Poet's Text. The Cafe is this; Shylock, a Jew, lends Anthonio, a Venetian Merchant, 30oo Ducats on Bond, with Condition, that if he did not pay them at aDay certain, the Jew might claim the Forfeiture of a Pound of A4thonio's Flelh to be cut from the Parts nearest to his Heart. The Bond becomes forfeited; and the Jew rigidly insists upon the fpecifick Penalty, and will accept no Sum whatever to remit that. But how does MlIalice bear down Truth in this Process? Or what one Circumflance is there in the Cause, whereby Truth or FalI/ood can come linto the Queflion ? I cannot suppose that by Truth the Poet means Jlflice, an the Equity of the Thing; if That had been his Thought, there is a Monosyllable To much more proper and intelligible at hand to answer that Senfc, that he would unqueltionably have laid That Malice bears down Right. - --- But I am perluaded that SIAKESPEARE intended BaOfanio should intimate, if the Jew would come to no Terms, nor take his Debt though tender'd with such large Advantage, it was plain, he was so blood-thirfly that his Malice had got the better of his Passion of Interest, and extinguilh'd all Sentiments of Remorse, Tender- Â»efj, and human Charity. The Stress of the Affair lies betwixt the Jew's Malice, and the Interceflions of the Court to him to be merciful. This is the Trenour of the whole Scene; and consonant to this Meaning, the a'Dke addresses himself to Shyloek, so soon as he appears at the Bar, in there Words; Page 64.,Shylock,

But what does the Poet mean by Refpefl and Fortmunes What Respect? If Lear would have bestowed the third Part of his Dominions, as he had contrac- ted, that was all the Refpec which Burgundy would have flood upon with her. I would willingly reltore it with my Quarto Edition, publilh'd in 16fS, which 1 presume never came to theEditor's View.,--------- Peace be with Burgundy!

the World, is that a Realon why We fnauld submit to live to be old ? - I Ihould rather have th.o-gt it an Arjgment for the putting an End to a miserable Life. There is so flagrant a Ps-axs in Sense, as the Tert now lunds, that, tho' all the Editions unhappily countenance it. I conceive, Mr. POPE might very safely have indulg'd his private Sense here. I commu- nicated my Objections upon this Place (as I have upon many others) to my late ingenious Friend Dr. SETWL, (whom Death has lince robbed meof, tho' his Merit will long out-live these poor Sheets :) who gave me this Conjecture upon It.,----------- 0 Iorld!

'Tis vrell known, .-tasm is one of the poetical Names of the Sun; but we have no Authority from Fable for Than's melting away at his own fwcet Tale, as Narrcifi did at the Reflec- ton of his own sweet Form.

Is Hamlet supposed to reason here, that, because he had seen a few very prepolterous Players, therefore he Should think Nature's Journeymen had made all Alankind? for so Aleu in this Place, without Some or those prefixed, mull imply. No, those Players were so far from appearing human Creatures, that he could scarce imagine them the Handy-Work of Nature, but of Some of her clumsy Journeymen.

From the whole Tenour of this Speech of the Princess, who is fresh in Sorrow on Account of her Father's Death, and who is making Apologies for any Thing that She may have Paid too freely to the King, 'tis plain, this Sentiment is the direa Oppolite to the Poet's Meaning.

This is a Scene in which the Acors are Masqueraders; and Pedro, the Prince of Airagosr, fixing his Discourse on Hero, asks her whether the will walk away with him ? Yes, fays She, when I like your Figure better ; for, God forbid, the Lute should be like the Cafe: i. e. that your Face should be as homely and as coarfeas yourMafque. Upon This, Pedro compares his Vilbr to Phi/leon's Roof.

Bancir and Philemon, 'tis true, had liv'd to Old- Age together, in a comfortable State of Agreement: But Piety and Hospitality are the Top Parts of their Character. Our Poet, if I am not mistaken, goes a little deeper into theStory. Tho' this old Pair liv'd in a Cottage, this Cottage received two Dfraggling * Gods under its Jupit Roof. So, Pedro is a Prince ; and tho' his Visor is but ordinary, He would inlinuate to Me:P Hero, that he has fomethinggodlike within : Alludhlg either to his Dignity, or the Qualities of his Person and Mind. By these Circumllances, 1 am sure, the Thought is mended : And I have no Doubt, but the Poet's Text ought tobe so too. Read, therefore, with only cutting offthe Tail of a lingle Letter;,Pedro.

I am very free to own, as it is here, and in all the preceding Editions, exhibited, it seems to have so little Meaning, that it is very unworthy of our Author. But if by a very flight, yet certain, Alteration, can both give it a Meaning, and a fine Sentiment; it may be worth while to reatore the Poet his own Text. The Cafe is this: Eleanor, Dutchess of Gloacefler, resorting to Conjurers and Wizards to be refolv'd of the Fate of the King and several of the Court, is caught inthe Fa& by the Dukes of Tork and Bnckingham; the Parties being appre- hended, and their Papers seized, 2ork fays he'll fee the Devil's Writ; and reading over the Answers which the Wizards had given, and finding 'em intricate and ambiguous, he males this general Comment upon such Sort of Intelligence. But how are These Oracles hardly at- tainmed 'Tis plain, they were alually attained, and taken down in Writing; or the Difcove- rers could never have come to the Knowledge of them.

All the Lines from the Aflerisk are degraded by Mr. POPE ; partly, I suppose, for the Rea- son which he gives ill his Preface for thefeDegradations; but chiefly, believe, because he did not underlhand them.

Aotony is giving several Reasons to Cleopatra, which make his Departure from SREpt ab- folutely necessary; molt of them Reasons of State; but theDeath of Fnlvia, his Wife, was a particular and private Call, which demanded his Presence in Italy. But the Poet's Text, I find, in all the printed Copies, would rather make us believe that Fnlvia's Death Ihould pre- vent, or save him the Trouble of going. The Text in this Refpe&, I dare engage, runs counter to its Mailer's Meaning. Cleopatra is jealous of Antony's Absence, and suspicious that he is seeking Colours for his Going: Antony replies to her Doubts, with the Reasons that obliged him to be gone for a Time; and tells her that, as his Wife Filvia is dead, and so She has no Rival to be jealous of, that Circumltance flould be his belt Plea and Excuse, and have the greatest Weight with her for his Going.

EmdrEDTIOr,We have SCORCH'D the Snake, not kil'd it.--- She'll close, and be herelf; ------ This is a Paflage which has all along pass'd current thro' the Editions, and likewise upon the Stage; and yet, I dare affirm, is not our Author's Reading. What has a Snake, cloing again, to do with its being fcorch'd? Scorching would never either separate, or dilate, its Parts; but rather make them inltantly contral and/hrivel. SHAKESPEARE, I am very wellperfuaded, had this Notion in his Head, (which how true in Fa&, I will not pretend to determine,) that it you cut a Serpent, or Worm asunder, in several Pieces, there is such an unaious Quality in their Blood, that the difmember'd Parts, being only plac'd near enough to touch one an- other, will cement and become as whole as before the Injury receiv'd. The Application of this Thought is to ~Dnncan, the murther'd King, and his surviving Sons: Macbeth conliders them so much as Members of the Father, that tho' he has cut off the old Man, he would fay, he has not entirely kill'd him; but he'll cement and close again in the Lives of his Sons to the Danger of Miasbeth. If I am not deceiv'd therefore, our Poet certainly wrot thus;,We have SCOTCH'D the Snake, not kiid it. ----- She'll clofi, and be her self; ----- Tofotch, however the Generality of our DiSionarie happen to omit the Word, fgnifies to notch, fia/b, cut with Twigs, Sword, yfc. and so SHAKESPEARE more than once has used it in his Works. So CORIOLANUS, Page 182.,Hewastoo hardforhim direiAly, to faythe roth on't: BeforeCorioli, he SCOTCH'D him, and notch'd him, like a Carbonado.

But I do not take this to be the Poet's Thought. The second Folio Edition reads it thus;,ISTIRRE t.p. the Sons of Troy. This.odd Manner of Spelling the Word both gaveme a Suspicion of the-Place being corrupt, and adminifter'd tomy Coniecture for.relloring it. The Author, I take it, means no more than This; that the Greeks have pitch'd their Tents upon the Plains before Troy; and that the Trojans are securely barricaded within the Walls of their City. I have no Doubt therefore but we ought to read;,SPERRE r.p the Sons of Troy. For, tofperre, orffar, (from the old T'etonic Word, fteret,) signifies topnt. up, defend by Bars, &c.

Here again, if I am not mifLisen, we meet with frefn Corruption. Catuir.lria is a very oddWord; and,I am well 1fisied a deprav'd One.

When we come to conlider that there is some Power else besides balmy Air, that brings forth, and makes the tender Buds spread Themselves, I do not think it improbable that the Poet wrote thus,E're He cavfpread is sweet Leaves to thi Air, Or dedicate his Beauty to the SUN. * * Or Sunne, attaerr to the old SPeling, Uish brig itanarer ro the Traces ofthecorrhted Text .

If there ever was such a Thing as a Crowkeeper, in Nature, I mull own it is an Employment quite out of my Acquaintance. And surely, the Poet cannot be supposed to intend by it, a Man arm'd to keep off the Crows ? .-- I would read it, calhiering only afingleLetter;,Scaring the Ladies like a COW-KEEPER. The Herdsmen of Old were used to watch in the Field, with Bows and Arrows, to defend their Cattle either from Dogs, or any other Injuries: Objets very likely to feare the Ladies, both from the Size of theirBows, and their aukward Method of managing them. What gives me the Foundation for this Suspicion and Emendation is the following Passage in K. LEAR, Page 86.:,Lear. 7'here'syour Prefi-mony. --- That Fellow handles hir Bow like a COW-KEEPER. For so Mr. POPE has very rightly rellor'd it ;tho' thefecond Folio Edition, (as does also my Quarto, publifh'd in 65'5.) reads it here too absurdly --- Crowkeeper. CV. HASLET, Page 382. EIEK:DATrOlu;,Mean tirme, we thank you for youtr Well-TOOK Laboor. I have Nothing to objec to the Sense of this Passage, which I forgot to take Notice of inmy Examination of this Play. The second Folio Edition however has a various Reading, which gives some Room for fufpeting the Text as it now (lands. It is there,,Mean time, We think Tor foryour Well-LOOK'D Labour. It is probable the Poet might, therefore, have wrote,,Mean time, We thankyou foryoer WeI-LUCK'D Laborrr. To fay,that their Labour had been well-took, is faying, methinks, only that they had notlabsorf, in vain: But to fay it was well-lirck'd, is palling a Sort of Complement on the Addrefi, Shill, and Good Fortune, of the Persons employ'd in it. This ConjeAure is of no great Momenr, but I embrac'd the Mention of it the more rea- dily, becaufc it lends me an Opportunity.of correfting. Myself upon Another Passage of the fame Play. I should reckon it very dilingenuous, as well as ridiculous, in a Work which I have profefs'd to have undertaken for the Reitoration of SLHAKESPEARE, if I Ihould be alham'd to own myself miflaken, and retrat the Error. In my Eighty Ninth Remark upon * HAMLET, * Pag. ,9. ,- I have call'd in Queflion the Text upon two Pafages,. where the Poet has made Use ot the seq.,Word
Wod- UNBATED. To avoid Repitition and Prolixity, I (hall beg Leave to refer the Rea- ders b-:k to that Note. Since my Beginning this Appendix, I have chang'd my Opinion 2nd begin to think the Text may rather be exp'aie'd, than di/ltirb'd or alter'd. The Poet is f-anir.g of Swcrds and -F.:ls, and by a Sword UNBATED, perhaps, hemay mean a Sword nr.-s:cd, or nor robb'd of its Point, to diltinguiih it from a Fo)l, which is bluntid and charg'd t the End with a Izt : n. If we are to suppose the Poet wrote litbaited, ordaub'd over with an Oinener, (as I there conje&lred.) it is absurd for Laertes to reply to the King, who tells him he might eafliy chafe a Sword ready bnited, that he would anoint his Sword for the Par- Ser: Nor cm there be any Occa!ion in the Seor.i Pallage for the Epithet ENVENOM'D as o-:.e;a fign~ies t.e fa'e TFing.

I have already obferv'd, in the Course of these Sheets, that it is usual with SHAKESPEARE, thro' Negligence or Licentiousness, to change his Numbers, as he does here: So no more need be laid on that Head. Tofipple, 'tis well known, is to make pliant and flexible; and is particularly a Term in Surgery, when any Part, fwoln and stiff, is by Fomentations, &c. reduced, and madefoft andpliable. To convince, here, is peculiar in its Sense; it is not, as in the common Acceptation, to make sensible of the Truth of any Thing by Reasons and Arguments; but to overcome, get the better of, &c. As the Usage of the Term in this Sort is one of the Author's Singularities, I'll produce two or three Passages, in Support of This before us, where it bears the fame Sense.

I may, indeed, fay with Mr. POPE, thatI have gone thro' this Work with more Labour than I can expect Ihanks: I have run a Rifque, and must wait the Sentence of the Publick, whether I have gone upon a mistaken View of Reputation, or whether I have done any Thing to set SHAKESPEARE in a clearer Light than his Editors have hitherto done. It is upon this Issue I fiall be determin'd, whether I have already written too much on the Subje&; or, whether I may promise my self Encouragement in prosecuting a Delign, that favours more of publick Spirit than private Interest. I ought to be in some Pain for the Figure that these Sheets may make, this being the firfi Essay of literal Criticlfm upon any Author in the ENGLISH Tongue. The Alteration of a Letter, when it restores Sense to a corrupted Passage, in a learned Language, is an Atchieve- ment that brings Honour to the Critick who advances it: And Dr. BENTLEY will be remem- ber'd to Poflenty for his Performances of this Sort, as long as the World fiall have any Es- teem for the Remains of Menaander and Philemon.
