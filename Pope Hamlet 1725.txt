
HAMLET, Prince of Denmark. ACT I. SCENE I. An open Place before the palace. Enter Bernardo and Francisco, two centinels. BERNARDO. HO's there? Fran. Nay, answer me: itand and unfold your seif. Ber. Long live the King. Fran. Bernardo? Ber. He. Fran. You come molt carefully upon your hour. Ber. 'Tis now afruck twelve, get thee to bed, Francisco. Fran. For this relief, much thanks: 'tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart. Ber. Have you had quiet guard. Fran. Not a mouse stirring. Ber. Well, good-night. If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make hate. Enter Horatio and Marcellus. Fran. I think I hear them. Stand; who's there? VOL. VI. X x Hor.
Hor. Friends to this ground. Mar. And liege-men to the Dane. Fran. Give you good-night. Mar. Oh farewel, honefl soldier; who hath reliev'd you r Fran. Bernardo has my place: give you good-night. [Exit Francisco. Mar. Holla, Bernardo. Ber. Say, what is Horatio there? Hor. A piece of him. Ber. Welcome Horatio, welcome good Marcellus. Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night ? Ber. I have seen nothing. Mar. Horatio says, 'tis but our phantafie, And will not let belief take hold of him, Touching this dreaded fight, 'twice seen of us; Therefore I have intreated him along With us, to watch the minutes of this night, That if again this apparition come, He may approve our eyes, and speak to it. Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear. Ber. Sit down a while, And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our ifory, What we have two nights seen. Hor. Well, fit we down, And let us hear Bernardo speak of this. Ber. Last night of all, When yon fame flar, that's wefiward from the pole, Had made his course t'illume that part of heav'n Where now it burns, Marcellus and my self, The bell then beating one----- Mar. Peace, break thee off; Enter
Enter the Ghofi. Look where it comes again. Ber. In the fame figure, like the King that's dead. Mar. Thou art a scholar, speak to it, Horatio. Ber. Looks it not like the King ? mark it, Horatio. Hor. Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder. Ber. It would be spoke to. Mar. Speak to it, Horatio. Hor. What art thou that ufurp'ft this time of night, Together wi-th that fair and warlike form, In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometime march ? by Heav'n I charge thee speak. Mar. It is offended. Ber. See! it ifalks away. Hor. Stay; speak; I charge thee, speak. [Ex. Ghofl. Mar. 'Tis gone, and will not answer. Ber. How now, Horatio ? you tremble and look pale. Is not this something more than phantafie? What think you of it ? Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe, Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes. Mar. Is it not like the King? Hor. As thou art to thy fells Such was the very armour he had on, When he th' ambitious Norway combated: So frown'd he once, when in an angry parle, He smote the fleaded a Polack on the ice. 'Tis strange----- Mer. Thus twice before, and juft" at this b dead hour, With martial fialk, hath he gone by our watch. * Pole-axe in the common editions; he/ peaks of a prikce of Pilarid whonmhe flewl irt battle. He uses the word Polack again, act. 2. /cene 4. b ame. Xx z Hor.
Hoir. In what particular thought to work, I know not: But in the gross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some ifrange eruption to our Rfate. Mar. Good now fit down, and tell me, he that knows, Why this fame strict and mofi obfervanr watch So nightly toils the subjects of the land? And why such daily cast of brazen cannon, And foreign mart for implements of war ? Why such impress of hipwrights, whose fore task Does not divide the funday from the week ? What might be toward, that this sweaty hafre Doth make the night joint labourer with the day: Who is't that can inform me ? H-or. That can I, At least the whisper goes Co. Our lafi King, Whose image even but now appear'd to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, (Thereto prickt on by a most emulate pride) Dar'd to the fight. In which, our valiant Hamlet, (For so this fide of our known world efteem'd him) Did flay this Fortinbras: who by feal'd compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit (with his life) all those his lands Which he flood feiz'd of to the Conqueror: Against the which, a moiety competent Was gaged by our King; which had return To the inheritance of fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher, as by that cov'nant And carriage of the articles defign'd, His fell to Hamlet. Now young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full, Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, Shark'd up a lift of landless refolutes, For
For food and dyet, to some enterprize That hath a fiomach in't: which is no other, And it doth well appear unto our slate, But to recover of us by firong hand And terms compulfative, those foresaid lands So by his father loft: and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch, and the chief head Of this post-haste and romage in the land. Ber. I think it be no other, but even so: Well may it fort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch so like the.King, That was and is the question of these wars. Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. In the most high and t palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiefl Julius fell, The graves flood tenantless, the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman itreets, Stars fhon with trains of fire, dews of blood fell, Disasters veil'd the fun, and the moist flar Upon whole influence Neptune's empire fiands, Was sick almofi to doom's-day with eclipse. And even the like precurfe of fierce events, As harbingers preceding fiill the fates, And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heav'n and earth together demonlfrated Unto our climatures and country-men. Enter Ghost again. But sos, behold! lo, where it comes again! I'll cross it, though it blai me. Stay, illusion! [Spreading his arms. If t palmy for vi&orious; in the other editions flouriflhing.
If thou hafl any found, or use of voice, Speak to me. If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee do ease, and grace to me; Speak to me. If thou art privy to thy country's fate, Which happily foreknowing may avoid, Oh speak!------ Or, if thou hafl uphoorded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, [Cock For which, they fay, you spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it. Stay, and speak ------ Stop it, Marcel/us ----- Mar. Shall I strike it with my partizan ? Hor. Do, if it will not feand. Ber. 'Tis here ------ FHor. 'Tis here ------ Mer. 'Tis gone. [Exit We do it wrong, being so majeffical, To offer it the ihew of violence; For it is as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows, malicious mockery. Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew. Hor. And then it ifarted like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons. I have heard, The cock that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and ftrili-founding throat Awake the God of day; and at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, Th' extravagant and erring spirit hyes To his confine. And of the truth herein, This presfent object made probation. Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some fay, that ever 'gainft that season comes Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, crows. Ghoji. The
The bird of dawning fingeth all nlight lotig: And then, they fay, no spirit walks abroad, The nights are wholfome, then no planets stRike, No Fairy takes, no witch hath power to chartii; So hallow'd and so gracious is the time. Hor. So have I heard, and do in part believe it. But look, the morn in ruffec mantle clad, Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill; Break we our watch up, and by my advice Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet. For upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him: Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty? Mar. Let's do't, I pray, and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently. SCENE Ep II. The Palace. Enter Claudius King of Denmark, Gertrude the 9ieen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand, Cornelius, lords and attendants. King. ' HOU G H yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death 1. The memory be green; and that it fittied To bear our hearts in grief, a'd oi~ whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe; Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature, That we with wisest sorrow think on hirm, Together with remembrance of our selves. Therefore our sometime sifter, now our"Queni, Th' imperial jointress of this warlike slate, Have we, as 'twere, with a defeated joy, _ __ __ _~
With one auspicious, and one dropping eye, With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole, Taken to wife. Nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along, (for all, our thanks.) Now follows, that you know young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth; Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our slate to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with this dream of his advantage; He hath not fail'd to pelter us with message, Importing the surrender of.thofe lands Loft by his father, by all bands of law To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for our self, and for this time of meeting: Thus much the bufiners is. We have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress His further gate herein. In that the levies, The lifts, and full proportions are all made Out of his fubje6ts; and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you [oaltamand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway; Giving to you no further personal power Of treaty with the King, more than the scope Which thefre dilated articles allow. Farewel, and let your hafe commend your duty. Vol. In that, and all things, will we shew our duty. King. We doubt in nothing, heartily farewel. [Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius. And now Laertes, what's the news with you? You
You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes? You cannot (peak of reason to the Dane, And lose your voice. What would'ft thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the Throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldt thou have, Laertes? Laer. My dread lord, Your leave and favour to return to France; From whence, though willingly I came to Denmark To ihew my duty in your coronation; Yet now I muRf confess, that duty done, My thoughts and wishes bend again tow'rd France: And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon. King. Have you your father's leave? what says Polonius? Pol. He hath, my lord, by labourfome petition, Wrung from me my flow leave; and at the last Upon his will I feal'i my hard consent. I do beseech you give him leave to go. King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes, time be thine, And thy befl graces; spend it at thy will. But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son ---- Ham. A little more than kin, and less than kind. King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you ? Ham. Not so my lord, I am too much i'th' fun. Queen. Good Hamlet cast thy b nighted colour off, And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. Do not, for ever, with thy veiled lids, Seek for thy noble father in the dulRi Thou know'ft 'tis common, all that live mull die, Passing through nature to eternity. Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.

Seems, madam ? nay, it is; I know not seems: 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor cuflomary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejeted 'haviour of the visage, Together with all forms, moods, thews of grief, That can denote me truly. There may seem, For they are actions that a man might play; But I have that within, which paffeth (how: These,. but the trappings, and the suits of woe. King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, To give there mourning duties to your father : But you must know, your father loft a father, That father his, and the surviver bound In filial obligation, for some term To do obsequious sorrow. But to perfevere' In obstinate condolement, is a course Of impious ftubbornefs, unmanly grief It (hews a will moRs incorrec to heav'n, A heart unfortify'd, a mind impatient, An underfLanding simple, and unfchool'd: For what we know must be, and is as common As any the must vulgar thing to sense, Why should we, in our peevish opposition, Take it to heart ? fie ? 'tis a fault to heav'n, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theam Is death of fathers, and who fiill hath cry'd, From the first coarse, 'till he that died to-day, " This must be fo." We pray you throw to earth This
This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father: for let the world take note, You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love, Than that which dearest father bears his son, Do I impart tow'rd you. For your intent In going back to school to Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire: And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefeft courtier, cousin, and our son. OQueen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet: I pr'ythee flay with us, go not to Wittenberg. Ham. I (hall in all my best obey you, madam. King. Why 'tis a loving, and a fair reply, Be as our self in Denmark. Madam, come, This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof No jocund healk that Denmark drinks to-day, But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell; And the King's rowfe the heav'n (hall bruit again Re-fpeaking earthly thunder. Come away. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Manet Hamlet. Ham. Oh that this too-too solid flesh would melt, Thaw, and resolve it self into a dew; Or that the Everlasting had not fixt His cannon 'gainft felf-flaughter. Oh God! oh God! How weary, flale, flat, and unprofitable Seem to me all the uses of this world ? Fie on't! oh fie! 'tis an unweeded garden Yy z That
That grows to feed; things rank, and gross in nature Possess it meerly that it should come thus. But two months dead! nay, not so much; not two, ---- So excellent a King, that was, to this, Hyper;ion to a satyr: so loving to my mother, That he permitted not the winds of heav'n Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Mull I remember ? ----- why, the would hang on him, As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on; yet within a month?---- Let me not think----- Frailty, thy name is woman! A little month! .----or e'er those (hooes were old With which the follow'd my poor father's body, Like Niobe, all tears --- Why (he, ev'n she, ----- Oh heav'n! a beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mourn'd longer ----- married with mine uncle, My father's brother; no more like my father, Than I to Hercules. Within a month! ----- Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her gauled eyes, She married. Oh most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to inceffuous sheets: It is not, nor it cannot come to good. But break, my heart, for I mull hold my tongue. SCENE IV. Enter Horatio, Bernardo, and Marcellus. HIor. Hail to your lordship. Ham. I am glad to fee you well, Horatio ? or I do forget my self ? Hor. The fame, my lord, and your poor servant ever. Ham. Sir, my good friend, I'll change that name with you: And
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio ? Marcellus / ----- Mar. My good lord-- Ham. I am very glad to fee you; good even, Sir. But what, in faith, make you from WIittenberg? Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord. Ham. I would not ' hear your enemy fay so; Nor shall you do mine ear that violence, To make it truRer of your own report Against your self. I know you are no truant; But what is your affair in Elfinoor ? We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart. Hor. My lord, I came to fee your father's funeral. Ham. I pr'ythee do not mock me, fellow-fhudent; I think it was to fee my mother's wedding. Hor. Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon. Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio: the funeral bak'd meats Did coldly firnifh forth the marriage tables. Would I had met my dearest foe in heav'n, Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio. My father-----methinks I fee my father. Hor. Oh where, my lord? Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio. Hor. I saw him once, he was a goodly King. Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again. Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yefternight. HJam. Saw! who?--- Hor. My lord, the King your father. Ham. The King my father! Hor. Season your admiration for a while With an attentive ear; 'till I deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you. Ham. ' have
Ham. For heaven's love, let me hear. Hor. Two-nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch, In the dead waRe and middle of the night, Been thus encountred. A figure like your father, Arm'd at all points exatly, Cap-a-pe, Appears before them, and with solemn march Goes flow and stately by them; thrice he walk'd, By their opprefl and fear-furprized eyes, Within his truncheon's length; whilst they (diftill'd Almost to jelly with the a& of fear) Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I with them the third night kept the watch, Where as they had deliver'd both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes. I knew your father: These hands are not more like. Ham. But where was this ? Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watcht. Ham. Did you not speak to it ? Hor. My lord, I did; But answer made it none; yet once methought It lifted up its head, and did address It self to motion, like as it would speak: But even then the morning cock crew loud; And at the found it shrunk in haste away, And vanifht from our fight. Ham. 'Tis very itrange. Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true; And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it. Ham. Indeed, Sirs, but this troubles me. . \ Hold
Hold you the watch to-night? Both. We do, my lord. Ham. Arm'd, fay you? Both. Arm'd, my lord. Ham. From top to toe? Both. My lord, from head to foot. Ham. Then saw you not his face ? Hor. Oh yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up. Ham. What, look'd he frowningly ? Hor. A count'nance more in sorrow than in anger. Ham. Pale, or red ? Hor. Nay, very pale. Ham. And fixt his eyes upon you Hor. Moit conifantly. Ham. I would I had been there. Hor. It would have much amaz'd you. Ham. Very like; itaid it long? Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred. A/i. Longer, longer. Hor. Not when I faw't. Ham. His beard was grisly ? Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life, A fable-filver'd. Ham. I'll watch to-night; perchance 'twill walk again. Hor. I warrant you it will, Ham. If it assume my noble father's person, I'll speak to it, tho' hell it felffhould gape And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all, If you have hitherto conceal'd this fight , Let it be d treble in your silence still : And whatsoever (hall befall to-night, Give it an understanding, but no tongue I will requite your loves: so, fare ye well. Upon d tenable.
Upon the platform 'twixt eleven and twelve '11 visit you. All. Our duty to your honour. Ham. Your love, as mine to you : farewel. My father's spirit in arms ? all is not well; I doubt some foul play: would the night were come; 'Till then fit fiill, my foul : foul deeds will rife, (Tho' all the earth o'erwhelm them) to mens eyes. SCENE V. An Apartment in Polonius's house. Enter Laertes and Ophelia. Laer. Y necessaries are imbark'd, farewel ; And sifter, as the winds give benefit, And convoy is afliftant ; do not sleep, But let me hear from you. Oph. Do you doubt that Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favours, Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood, A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent, tho' sweet, not lasting, *The perfume, and suppliance of a minute ; No more. Oph. No more but so ? Laer. Think it no more: For nature crescent does not grow alone, In t thews and bulk ; but as his temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and foul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves yowunow, And now nof foil nor cautel doth befmerch The virtue of his g will: but you must fear * TZhe suppliance of a minute. His f foil. ' fear. [Exeunt. [Exit. __ __ __ "f thews, or ~ualities.
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own: For he himself is fubjet to his birth; He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself; for on his choice depends The san&ity and health of the whole state. And therefore must his choice be circumfcrib'd Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he's head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it, As he in his peculiar h a& and place May give his saying deed; which is no further, Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may fultain, If with too credent ear you lift his songs, Or lose your heart; or your charte treasure open To his unmafter'd importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear fifler, And keep within the rear of your affe&ion, Out of the shot and danger of desire. The charieft maid is prodigal enough, If mhe unmask her beauty to the moon: Virtue it felif fcapes not calumnious firokes, The canker galls the infants of the spring, Too oft before their buttons be difclos'd; And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blaftments are most imminent. Be wary then, best safety lies in fear; Youth to it self rebels, though none else near. Oph. I shall th' effe&s of this good lesson keep, As watchman to my heart. But good my brother, Do not, as rome ungracious pastors do, Shew me the steep and thorny way to heav'n; \Whilst like a puft and careless libertine, V o L. VI. Zz Him- b feil and force.

I stay too long; --but here my father comes: A double blessing is a double grace; Occasion smiles upon a second leave. Pol. Yet here, Laertes./ get aboard for flhame, The wind fits in the shoulder of your fail, And you are (laid for there. My blessing with you; And these few precepts in thy memory See thou character. ' Give thy thoughts no tongue, ' Nor any unproportion'd thought his aet: ' Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar; ' The friends thou hari, and their adoption try'd, ' Grapple them to thy foul with hooks of steel: ' But do not dull thy palm with entertainment ' Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware ' Of Entrance to a quarrel: but being in, ' Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee. ' Give ev'ry man thine ear; but few thy voice. * Take each man's censure; but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not expreft in fancy; rich, not gaudy: For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the bel rank and flation Are most select and generous, chief in that. Neither a borrower, nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both it self and friend: A borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This t recks not his own reed, that is, heeds not his own lessons.
This above all ; to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewel; my bleding season this in theet Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord. Pol. The time invites you, go, your servants tend. Laer. Farewel Ophelia, and remember well What I have said. Oph. 'Tis in my mem'ry lockt, And you your self shall keep the key of it. Laer. Farewel. [Exit Laer. Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he laid to you ? Oph. So please you, fomeching touching the lord Hamlet Pol. Marry, well bethought! 'Tis told me he hath very oft of late Given private time to you; and you your self Have of your audience been most free and bounteous. If it be so, as so 'tis put on me, And that in way of caution, I must tell you, You do not understand your self so clearly, As it behoves my daughter, and your honour. What is between you? give me up the truth. Oph. He hath, my lord, of late, made many tenders Of his affe&tion to me. Pol. Affeaion! puh! you [peak like a green girl, Unfifted in such perilous circumstance. Do you believe his tenders, as you call them ? Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think. Pol. Marry I'll teach you; think your self a baby, That you have ta'en his tenders for true pay, Which are not Gferling. Tender your self more dearly; Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,) Wronging it thus, you'll tender me a fool. Zz z O8f0
Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love, In honourable fashion. Pol. Ay, fashion you may call't: go to, go to. Oph. And hath giv'n count'nance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven. Pol. Ay, fpringes to catch woodcocks. I do know When the blood burns, how prodigal the foul Lends the tongue vows. There blazes, oh my daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both, Ev'n in their promise as it is a making, You muff not take for fire. From this time, Be somewhat fcanter of your maiden presence, Set your intreatments at a highter rate, Than a command to parley. For lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young; And with a larger t tether may he walk, Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers, 'Not of that die which their inveffments shew, But meer implorers of unholy suits, Breathing like fanaified and pious bonds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would nor, in plain terms, from this time forth, Have you so slander any moment's leisure, As to give words or talk with the lord Hamlet. Look to't, I charge you; come your way.

Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, Quarrelling, drabbing ---- You may go so far. Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him. Pol. Faith no, as you may season it in the charge; You must not put another scandal on him, That he is open to incontinency, That's not my meaning; but breathe his faults so quaintly, That they may seem the taints of liberty, The flash and out-break of a fiery mind, A savageness in unreclaimed blood Of general assault. Rey. But, my good lord---- Pol. Wherefore should you do this ? Rey. Ay, my lord, I would know that. Pol. Marry, Sir, here's my drift, And I believe it is a fetch of wit. You laying these flight rallies on my son, As 'twere a thing a little foil'd i'th' working, Mark you your party in converse; him you would found, Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes, The youth you fpeaklof guilty, be affur'd He closes with you in this consequence; Good Sir, or so, or friend, or gentleman, (According to the phrase or the addition, Of man and country.)

Pale as his thirt, his knees knocking each other, And with a look so piteous in purport, As if he had been loosed out of hell, To speak of horrors; thus he comes before me. Pol. Mad for thy love ? Oph. My lord, I do not know: But truly I do fear it. Pol. What said he? Oph. He took me by the wrist, and held me hard, Then goes he to the length of all his arm; And with his other hand, thus o'er his brow, He falls to such perusal of my face, As he would draw it, Long time ifaid he so; At last, a little h(aking of my arm, And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He rais'd a sigh, so piteous and profound, That it did seem to (hatter all his bulk, And end his being. Then he lets me go, And with his head over his shoulder turn'd, He feem'd to find his way without his eyes, For out-a-doors he went without their help, And to the laif, bended their light on me. Pol. Come, go with me, I will go Leek the King. This is the very ecfiafie of love, Whose violent property foredoes it self, And leads the will to defp'rate undertakings, As oft as any pafflion under heav'n, That do's afflict our natures. I am sorry; What, have you giv'n him any hard words of late? Oph. No, my good lord; but as you did command, I did repel his letters, and deny'd His access to me. Pol. That hath made him mad. I'm
I'm sorry that with betterb heed and judgment I had not quoted him. Ifear'd he trifl'd And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jeaioufie; It seems it is as proper to our age, To cast beyond our selves in our opinions, As it is common for the younger fort To lack discretion.

Ham.

All which, Sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down: for your self, Sir, Ihall be as old as-I-am, if like a crab you could go backward. Pol. Though this-be madness, yet there's method in't: Will you walk out of the air, my lord ? Ham. Into my grave ? Pol. Indeed that is out o'th' air: How pregnant (foretimes) his replies are ? A happiness that often madness hits on, Which faniry and reason could not be So profp'roufly diliver'd of. I'll leave him, And suddenly contrive the means of meeting Between him and my daughter.

Rof We think not so, my lord. Ham. Why then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison. Rof Why then your ambition makes it one: 'tis too narrow for your mind. Ham. Oh God, I could be bounded in a nut-shell, and count my self a King of infinite space were it not that I have bad dreams. Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very sub- fiance of the ambitious, is meerly the shadow of a dream. Ham. A dream it self is but a shadow. Rof.

You were Cent for; and there is a kind of confeffion in your looks, which your modefties have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen have lent for you. Rof To what end, my lord? Ham. That you mult teach me; but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preferved love, and by what more dear, a better proposer could charge you withal; be even and di- ret with me, whether you were sent for or no ? Rof What fay you ? Ham. Nay then I have an eye of you: if you love me, hold not off. Guil. My lord, we were sent for. Ham. I will tell you why, so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of late, but wherefore I know not, loft all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercise; and indeed, it goes so
so heavily with my disposition, that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a fleril promontory; this mofi excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave o'er-hanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me, than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in fa- culties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in amtion how like an angel! in apprehension how like a God! the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! and yet to me, what is this quintessence of dut ? man delights not me; nor woman neither, tho' by your smiling you seem to fay so. Rof My lord there was no such ftuff in my thoughts. Ham. Why did you laugh, when 1 said, man delights not me? Rof. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, whatlen- ten entertainment the Players fhball receive from you; we accotR- ed them on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service. Ham. He that plays the King (hall be welcome; his majefly (hall have tribute of me;, the adventurous knight shall use his foyle and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man (hall end his part in peace; and the lady shall fay her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are they ? Rof. Even those you were wont to take delight in, the Trage- dians of the city. Ham. How chances it they travel? their residence both in re- putation and profit was better, both ways. Rof I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation. Ham. Do they hold the fame estimation they did when I was in the city ? are they so follow'd ? Rof No indeed, they are not. Ham. How comes it? do they grow rusty ? Rof Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there
there is, Sir, an t Airy of Children, little yafes, that cry out on the top of question; and are molt tyrannically clapt for't; these are now the fashion, and so be-rattle the common lfages (so they call them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills, and dare scarce come thither. Ham. What, are they Children ? who maintains 'em ? how are they efcoted? will they pursue the Quality no longer than they can sing ? will they not fay afterwards, if they should grow them- selves to common players ? as it is most like, if their means are no better: their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession. Rof Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no fin, to tarre them to controverfie. There was for a while no money bid for argument, unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the queflion. Ham. Is't possible ? Guil. Oh there has been much throwing about of brains. Ham. Do the boys carry it away ? Rof. Ay, that they do, my lord, Hercules and his load too. Ham. It is not itrange; for mine uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mowes at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an hundred ducates a-peice, for his pi&ture in little. There is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out. [FlouriT/ for the players. Guil. There are the players. Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elfinoor; your hands: come then, the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremo- ny. Let me comply with you in this garbe, left my extent to the players (which I tell you muff thew fairly outward) haould more appear like entertainment than yours.

Hark you, Guildenfjern, and you too, at each ear a hearer; that great baby you fee there, is not yet out of his (wath- ling clouts. Rof. Haply he's the second time come to them; for they fay, an old man is twice a child. Ham. I will prophefie, he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it, you fay right, Sir; for on Monday morning 'twas so indeed. Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you. Ham. My lord I have news to tell you, When RiJcius was an actor in Rome ------ Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord. Ham. Buzze, bczze. Pol. Upon mine honour------ Ham. Then came each ator on his ass----- Pol. The best adtors in the world, either for tragedy, come- dy, hiflory, pastoral, paftoral-comical, hiftorical-paftoral, scene undividable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light, for the law of wit, and the liberty. These are the only men. Ham. Oh Jephta, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou! Pal. What a treasure had he, my lord . Ham. IVhy one fair daughter, and no more, The which he loved passing well. Pol. Still on my daughter. Ham. Am I not i'th' right, old Jephta? Pol.
Pol. If you call me Jephta, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well. Ham. Nay, that follows not. Pol. What follows then, my lord ? Ham. Why as by lot, God mwot----and then you know, it came to pass, as mos like it was; the firfi row of the t rubrick will shew you more. For look where my abridgements come. Enter four or five players. Y'are welcome masters, welcome all. I am glad to fee thee well; welcome good friends. Oh! old friend! thy face is b valanc'd since I saw thee last: com'ft thou to beard me in Denmark? What my young lady and mistress ? berlady your ladyship is nea- rer heaven then whan I saw you last, by the altitude of at chiop- pine.

Come, give us a taste of your qua- lity; come, a passionate speech. I Play. What speech, my good lord? Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never a&ed: or if it was, not above once, for the play I remember pleas'd not the million, 'twas Caviar to the general; but it was, (as I receiv'd it, and others, whose judgment in such matters, cry- ed in the top of mine) an excellent play; well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said, there was no d salts in the lines, to make the matter savoury; nor no matter in the phrase, that might indite the au- thor of affeAion; but call'd it, an honest method. One speech in it I chiefly lov'd; 'twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priam'slDaughter. If it live in '-- Rubrick.

'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent, and good discretion. i Play. Anon he finds him, Striking, too short, at Greeks. His antique sword, Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls Repugnant to command ; unequal match'd, Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage firikes wide, But with the whif and wind of his fell sword Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium, Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear.

Oh what a rogue and peasant slave am I ?

For Hecuba? What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he ihould weep for her ? what would he do, Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have? he would drown the stage with tears, And cleave the gen'ral ear with horrid speech, Make mad the guilty, and appall the free, Confound the ign'rant, and amaze indeed The very faculty of eyes and ears.---- Yet I fay nothing; no, not for a King, Upon whole property and most dear life A damn'd defeat was made.

But that the dread of something after death, (That undifcover'd country, from whole bourne No traveller returns) puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have, Than fly to others that we know not of.

her neck. Lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She feeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poifonin the King's ears, and Exit. The ,ueen returns, finds the King dead, and makes pajfionate aEtlion. The poyfoner, with some two or three mutes come in a- gain, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried a- way. The poisoner wooes the gueen with gifts, Jhe seems loth and unwilling a while, but in the end accepts his love. [Exeunt. Oph. What means this, my lord ? Ham. Marry this is miching Mlalicho, that means mischief. Oph. Belike this (hew imports the argument of the play ? Ham. We (hall know by this fellow: the Players cannot .keep counsel, they'll tell all.

You are naught, you are naught, I'll mark the play. Enter Prologue. For us, and for our tragedy, Here flooping to your clemency, iWe beg your hearing patiently. Ham.

tjieen. So many journeys may the fun and moon Make us again count o'er, ere love be done. But woe is me, you are so tick of late, So far from cheer and from your former frate, That I distrust you; yet though I diflrurf, Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing mufl: And womens fear and love hold quantity, 'Tis either none, or in extremity; Now what my love is, proof hath made you know, And as my love is fix'd, my fear is so. King. Faith I must leave thee, love, and shortly too: My operant powers their funtions leave to do, And thou (halt live in this fair world behind, Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind For husband (halt thou ----- d9ueen. Oh confound the relt! Such love mulf needs be treason in my breat : In second husband let me be accurst, None wed the second, but who kill'd the first. . Ham. Wormwood, wormwood! %ueen. The instances that second marriage move, Are bare refpcts of thrift, but none of love. A second time I kill my husband dead, When second husband kisses me in bed. King. I do believe you think what now you (peak; But what we do determine, oft we break: Purpose is but the slave to memory, Of violecr birth, but poor validity: W\hich now, like fruits unripe, sticks on the tree, But fall unshaken, when they mellow be. Most necessary 'tis that we forget, To pay our selves what to our selves is debt: What
What to our selves in passion we propose, The paflion ending, doth the purpose lose; The violence of either grief or joy, Their own ena&ors with themselves defroy: Where joy most revels, grief doth mofl lament; Grief joys, joy grieves on slender accident. This world is nor for aye, and 'tis not firange That ev'n our loves should with our fortunes change. For 'tis a question left us yet to prove, Whether love fortune lead, or fortune love. The great man down, you mark his fav'rire flies; The poor, advanc'd, makes friends of enemies: And hitherto doth love on fortune tend, For who not needs, shall never lack a friend; And who in want a hollow friend doth try, Directly seasons him his enemy. But orderly to end where I begun, Our wills and fates do so contrary run, That our devices still are overthrown, Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own. So think thou wilt no second husband wed, But die thy thoughts, when thy firfi lord is dead. .ueen. Nor earth to give me food, nor heaven light, Sport and repose lock from me, day and night; Each opposite that blanks the face of joy, Meet what I would have well, and it defiroy, Both here, and hence, pursue me lasting strife!

This play is the image of a murther done in Vienna; Gonzago is the duke's name, his wife Baptifla; you (hall fee anon, 'tis a knavish piece of work; but what o' that your majefly, and we that have free fouls, it touches us not; let the gall'd jade winch, our withers are unwrung.

Rof Good my lord; what is your cause of dilltemper ? you do surely bar the door of your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend. Ham. Sir, I lack advancement. Rof.

Laer. It well appears. But tell me, Why you proceeded not against there feats, So crimeful and so capital in nature, As by your safety, wisdom, all things else, You mainly were ftirr'd up ? King. Two special reasons, Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unfinew'd, And yet to me are strong. The Queen, his mother, K k k z Lives --~--
Lives almost by his looks; and for my felts, My virtue or my plague, be't either which, She's so conjuntive to my life and foul ; That as the star moves not bat in his sphere, I could not but by her. The other motive, Why to a publick count I might not go, Is the great love the general gender hear him; Who dipping all his faults in their affedtion, Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone, Convert his gyves to graces. So my arrows Too slightly timbred for so loud a wind, Would have reverted to my bow again, And not where I had aim'd them. Laer. And so have I a noble father loft, A fifer driven into desperate terms, Whole worth, if praises may go back again, Stood challenger on mount of all the age For her perfetions -- But revenge will come.

If it be so, Laertes, As how should it be so ? ---. how otherwise ? ---- Will you be rul'd by me? Laer. I, so you'll not o'er-rule me to a peace. King. To thine own peace: if he be now return'd, As liking not his voyage, and that he means No more to undertake it; I will work him To an exploit now ripe in my devise, Under the which he shall not chufe but fall: And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe, But ev'n his mother shall uncharge the pradice, And call it accident. Laer. I will be rul'd, The rather if you could devifei it so That I might be the instrument. King. It falls right: You have been talkt of since your travel much, And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality Wherein they fay you rhine; your fum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him, As did that one, and that in my regard Of the unworthieft siege. Laer. What part is that, my lord? King. A very feather in the cap of youth, Yet
Yet needful too, for youth no less becomes The light and carelelfslivery that it wears, Than fettled age his fables, and his weeds, Importing health and graveness. Two months since Here was a gentleman of Normandy; I've seen my seif and ferv'd against the French, And they can well on horse-back; but this gallant Had witchcraft in't, he grew unto his feat; And to such wondrous doing brought his horse, As he had been iocorps'd and demy-natur'd With the brave beast; so far he past my thought, That I in forgery of shapes and tricks, Come short of what he did. Laer. A Norman was't? King. A Norman. Laer. Upon my life, Lamond. King. The very fame. Laer. I know him well, he is the brooch indeed, And gem of all the nation. King. He made confefion of you, And gave you fuich a maflerly report, For art and exercise in your defence; And for your rapier most especial, That he cry'd out, 'twould be a fight indeed, If one could match you. This report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy, That he could nothing do, but wish and beg Your sudden coming o'er to play with him. Now out of this --. Laer. What out of this, my lord? King. Laertes, was your father dear to you ? Or are you like the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart? Laer. Why ask you this ? King.
King. Not that I think you did not love your father, But that I know love is begun by time; And that I fee in passages of proof, Time qualifies the spark and fire of it: There lives within the very flame of love A kind of wick or fnuff that will abate it, And nothing is at a like goodness still; For goodness growing to a pleurifie, Dies in his own too much ; What we would do, We ihould do when we would; for this would changes, And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents, And then this should is like a fpend-thrift's sigh That hurts by eating; but to th' quick o' th' ulcer--- Hamlet comes back; what would you undertake To (hew your self your father's son indeed, More than in words? Laer. To cut his throat i'th' church. King. No place indeed should murther fanC&uarife; Revenge should have no bounds; but, good Laertes, Will you do this, keep close within your chamber? Hamlet return'd, mhall know you are come home: We'll put on those (hall praise your excellence, And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together, And wager on your heads. He being remiss, Most generous, and free from all contriving, Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease, Or with a little fhuffling, you may chufe A sword unbated, and in a pass of pra&ice Requite him for your father. Laer. I will do't; And for the purpose I'll anoint my sword:
I bought an unfl&iof of a mountebank, So mortal, that but dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood, no cataplasm so rare, Colle&ted from all simples that have virtue Under the moon, can save the thing from death, That is but fcratch'd withal; I'll touch my point With this contagion, if I gall him flightty It may be death. King. Let's further think of this, Weigh what convenience both of time and means May fit us to our shape. If this should fail, And that our drift look through our bad performance, 'Twere better not affay'd; therefore this proje& Should have a back, or second, that might hold, If this should blast in proof. Soft--let me fee--. We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings, I ha't --- when in your motion you are hot, And make your bouts more violent to th' end, And that he calls for drink; I'll have prepar'd him A chalice for the nonce; whereon but tipping, If he by chance escape your venom'd tuck, Our purpose may hold there. How now, sweet Queen? SCENE X. Enter jueen. Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel, So fast they follow: your fifter's drown'd, Laertes. Laer. Drown'd! oh where? e)een.

In youth when I did love, did love, Mlethought it was very sweet; To contrat oh the time for a my behove, Oh methought there was nothing meet. Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making ? Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness. Ham. 'Tis e'en so; the hand of little imployment hath the daintier fenfre. Clown sings. But age with his sealing fJeps, Hath claw'd me in his clutch: And hath shipped me into the land, As if I ne'er had been such. Ham. That scull had a tongue in it, and could sing once; how the knave jowles it to the ground, as if it were Cain's jaw- bone, that did the firfl murther! this might be the pace of a po- litician which this ass o'er-offices; one that could circumvent God, might it not? Hor. It might, my lord. Ham Or of a courtier, which could fay, good-morrow sweet lord; how dost thou, good lord ? this might be my lord such a one, that prais'd my lord such a ones horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not? Hor.. Ay, my lord. Ham. Why e'en so: and now my lady VWorm's, choplefs, and knockt about the mazzard with a fexton's spade. Here's fine revolution, if we had the trick to fee't.

There's another: why may not that be the scull of a lawyer? where be his quiddits now? his quillets his cafes? his tenures, and his tricks? why does he fuffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty ihovel, and will not tell him of his aÂ£tion of battery? hum! this fellow might be in's time a great buyer of land, with his flatutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures ? the very conveyances of his lands will hardly lye in this box; and mufl the inheritor himfelfhave no more? ha? Hor. Not a jot more, my lord. Ham. Is not parchment made of fheep-skins? Hor. Ay my lord, and ofcalve-skins too. Ham. They are sheep and calves that seek out assurance in that. I will speak to this fellow: Whole grave's this, sirrah ? Clown. Mine, Sir--. O, a pit of clay for to be made, For such a ghof is meet. Ham. I think it be thine indeed: for thou lief in't. Clown.

Cannot you tell :that? every fol can tell that: it .was ethat -very day that youog Hamlet was born, he that was mnad, and sent into England. Ham. Ay marry, why was he sent into England? Clown. Why, because he was mad; hie shall recover his wits there; or if he do not, it's no great matter there. Ham. Why? Clown. 'Twill not be seen in him, there the men are as mad as he. Ham. How came he mad ? Clown. Very firangely, they fay. Ham. How firangely ? Clown. Faith e'en with losing his wits. Ham. Upon what ground . Clown. Why, here in Denmark.

Ham. How long will a man lie i'th' earth ere lie rot? Clown. I'faith, if he be not rotten before he die, (as we have many pocky coarfes now-a-days, that will scarce hold the laying in) he will last you fomte eight year, or nine year; a tanner will last you nine years. Ham. Why he, more than another? Clown. Why Sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade, that he will keep out water a great while. And your water is a fore -de- cayer of your whorfon dead body.

Alas poor Tor'ek. I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of in- finite jeff; of most excellent fancy: he hath born me on his back a thousand times: and now how abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge riles at it. Here hung those lips that I have kifs'd 1 know not how oft. Where be your gibes now ? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table in a roar ? not one now, to mock your own grinning? quite chop-fallen? now get youto my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she muff come; make her laugh at that----.Pr'ythee, IHoratio, tell me one thing.

Is' possible? Ham. Here's the commission, read it at more leiure; But wilt thou hear now how I did proceed Y Hlor. I beseech you. Ham. Being thus benetted roundwith villains, Ere I could make a prologue to my brains, They had begun the play. I fate me down, Devis'd a new commiflion, wrote it fair: (I once did hold it as our ftatifRs do, A baseness to write fair; and labour'd much How to forget that learning; but, Sir, now It did me yeoman's fervicei) wilt thou know Th' effet of what I wrote ~ JHor. Ay, good my lord. Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King, As England was his faithful tributary, As love between them like the palm might flourifih, As peace should still her wheaten garland wear, And
And stand a comma 'tween their amities, And many such like As's of great charge; That on the view and knowing these contents, Without debatement further, more or lefts, He should the bearers put to fuidden death, No thriving time allow'd. Hor. How was this-.feald . Ham. Why ev'n in that was heaven ordinate;. I had my father's signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danhi feal:; I folded the writ up in form of th' other, Subfcrib'd it, gave th' impreflfion, plac'd it safely; The change was never known: now, the next day. Was our [ea-fight, and what to this was sequent, Thou know'ft already. Hor. So, Guildenfiern and 'Roftncrqoffe go to't. Ham. They are not near my conscience; their defeat Doth by their own insinuation grow: 'Tis dangerous when baser nature comes Between the pas, and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites. Hor.

He that hath kill'd my King, and whor'd my mother, Popt in between th' ele&ion and my hopes, Thrown out his angle for my proper life, And with such cozenage; is'c not perse& conscience, To qudt him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd, To let this canker of our nature come In further evil?

Ham. What's his weapon? Of./ Rapier and dagger. Ham. That's two of his weapons; but well. Ofr. The King, Sir, has wag'd with him fix Barbary horfet; against the which he impon'd, as I take it, fix French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, or so: three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit. Ham. What call. you the carriages ? Ofr. The carriages, Sir, are the hangers. Ham. Thephrafe would be more germane to the matter, if we could carry cannon by our sides; i would it might be hangers 'till then. But on; fix Barbary horses, against fix French swords, their afligns, and three liberal-conceited carriages, that's the French bett against the Damn/Fh; why is this impon'd, as you call it? Ofr. The King, Sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes between you and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate tryal, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer, Ham. How if I answer no? Oftr. I mean, my lord, the oppofirion of your person in cryal. Ham. Sir, I will. walk here in the hall; if it pleaft his majeflty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me ; let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the King holdhis purpose ; I will win for him if Lcan: if not, I'll gain nothing bur my ihame, and the odd hits.

Give me bur pardon, Sir, I've done you wrong, But pardon't, as you are a gentleman. This presence knows, and you must needs have heard How I am punished with fore diftration. What I have done That might your nature, honour, and exception Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness: Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes ? never Hamlet. If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away, And when he's not himself, do's wrong Laertes; Then Hamlet do's it not; Hamlet denies it: Who does it then ? his madness. If't be so, Hamlet is of the fa&ion that is wrong'd, His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy. Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil, Free me so far in your most generous thonughts, That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house, And hurt my b brother. Laer.

But if you know not this, my manners tell me, We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe That from the sense of all civility I thus would play, and trifle with your reverence.

For I do know, the slate, However this may gall him with some check, Cannot with safety ca& him. For he's embark'd With such loud reafin to the Cyprus wars, Which ev'n now itand in act, that for their fobuls, Another of his fadom they have none, To lead their business. In which regard, Tho' I do hate him as I do hell's pains, Yet, for necessity of.pirefent life, I mull hew out a flag and sign of love, (Which is indeed but sign.) That you may surely find him, Lead to the Sagittary the railed search; And there will I be with him. So farewel. [Exit. S C E N E II. Enter Brabantio in his night-gown, and servants with torches.

Oh treason of my blood! Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters minds By what you fee them ac. Are there not charms, By which the property of youth and maidhood May be abus'd? have you not read, Rodorigo, Of some such thing? Rod. Yes, Sir, I have indeed. Bra. Call up my brothers; oh would you had had her! Some one way, some another----Do you know Where we may apprehend her, and the Moor ? Rod. I think I can discover him, ifyou please To get good guard, and go along with me. Bra. Pray you lead on. At every house I'll call,. I may command at most; get weapons, hoa!

But I pray, Sir, Are you fast married ? fcr be fare of this, That the Magnifico is much.beloved, And hath in his effe& a voice potential As double as the Duke's: he will divorce you, Or put upon you what refltraint or grievance The law (with all his might t' enforce it on) Will give him cable. Oth. Let him do his fpight: My services, which I have done the Signoary, Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know, (Which, when I know that boaeiing is an honoaur, I shall promulgate) I fetch life and being From men of royal siege; and my demerits May speak, unbonneted, to as proud a fortune As this that I have reach'd. For know, Jago, Bu* that I love the gentle Defdemona, I would not my unhoufed free condition Put into circumscription and confine, For the seas worth. But look! what lights come yonder? S CE.N E V.

Jago. By Janus, I think no. Oth. The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant: The goodness of the night upon you, friends, What is the news ? Caf. The duke does greet you, General, And he requires your haste, post-haste appearance, Even on the instant. Oth. What is the matter, think you? Caf. Something from Cyprus, as I may divine: It is a business of some heat. The gallies H-ave sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night, at one anothers heels: And many of the consuls, rais'd and met, Are at the duke's already. You have been hotly call'd for, When being not at your lodging to be found, The senate lent above three several quefis, To search you out. Oth. 'Tis well I am found by you: I will but spend a word here in the house, And go with you. [Exit Othello. Caf. Ancient, what makes he here? Jago. Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carrac; If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever. Caf. I do not underfiand. Jago. He's married. Caf. To whom? Jago. Marry to--. Come, captain, will you go?

Down with him, thief. [They draw on both sides. Jago. You Rodorgo! come, Sir, I am for you-- Oth. Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust 'em. Good signior, you (hall more command with years, Than with your weapons. Bra. 0 thou foul thief! where hafi thou ffow'd my daughter ? Damn'd as thou art, thou haff enchanted her; For I'll refer me to all things of sense, If (he in chains of magick were not bound, Whether a maid, so tender, fair, and happy, So opposite to marriage, that (he fhunn'd The wealthy curled darlings of our nation, Would ever have, t'incur a general mock, Run from her guardage to the footy bosom Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight ? 4 Judge me the world, if'tis not gross in sense, That thou haft praais'd on her with foul charms, Abus'd her delicate youth, with drugs or minerals, That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on, 'Tis probable, and palpable tothinking; I therefore apprehend and do attach thee, For an abuser of the world, a praaicer Of arts inhibited and out of warrant; Lay hold upon him; if he do resist Subdue him at his peril.

To prison, 'till fit time Of law, and course of diret session Call thee to answer. Oth. What if I obey? How may the duke be therewith satisfied, Whose messengers are here about my fide, Upon some present business of the state, To bring me to him. Offi. True, most worthy signior, The duke's in council, and your noble self: I'm sure is sent for. Bra. How! the duke in council? In this time of the night? bring him away; Mine's not an idle cause. The duke himself, Or any of my brothers of the state, Cannot but feel this wrong, as 'twere their own; For if such actions may have passage free, Bond-flaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.

'Tis a pageant To keep us in false gaze; when we confider, T-i' iimportancy of Cyprus to the Thrk, And let our selves again but understand, That as it more concerns the Tlrk than Rhodes, So may he with more fertile question bear it, ^ For that it ifands not in such warlike brace, But altogether lacks th' abilities That Rhodes is dref&'d in.

A maiden, never bold; Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion Blufh'd at it seif; and fhlie, in fpighr of nature, Of years, of country, credit, every thing, To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on-- It is a judgment maim'd, and most imperfe&t, That will confess perfection so could err Against all rules of nature, and mult be driven To find out practices of cunning hell, Why this fhouid be.

Oh, they our are friends: but one cup, I'll drink for you. Caf. I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was craftily qualified too: and behold what innovation it makes here. I am unfortunate in the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any more. Jago. What, man? 'tis a night of revels, the gallants de- fire it. Caf. Where are they? Jago.

As I am an honest man, I had thought you had recei- ved some bodily wound; there is more.' sense in that than in re- putation. Reputation is an idle, and molt false imposition; oft got without merit, and loft without deserving. You:have loft no reputation at all, unless you repute your frlf fuoh a loser.

I may fay so, in this respect, for that he hath de- voted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and devotement of her parts and graces. Confess your self freely to her: importune her help, to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than the is requefled. This broken joint between you and her husband, intreat her to splinter. And my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow ifronger than it was before. Caf.

No, Jago, I'll fee before I doubt; when I doubt, prove; And on the proof, there is no more but this, Away at once with love, or jealoufie. Jago. I'm glad of this; for now I shall have reason To shew the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit. Therefore, as I'm bound, Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof. Look to your wife, observe her well with Caffio, Wear your eye, thus; not jealous, nor secure I would not have your free and noble nature Out of felf-bounty be abus'd; look to't. I know our country disposition well; In ienice they do let heav'n fee the pranks They dare not shew their husbands; their best conscience Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown. Oth. Dost thou fay so ? Jago. She did deceive her father, marrying you, And when she feem'd to shake, and fear your looks, She lov'd them most. Oth. And so (he did. Jago.

To feal her father's eyes up, close as oak--. He thought 'twas witchcraft--- but I'm much to blame: I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you. Obth. I'm bound to you for ever. Jago. I fee this hath a little dafh'd your spirits. Oth. Not a jot, not a jot. Jago. Trust me, I fear it has: I hope you will confider, what is spoke Comes from my love. But I do fee you're mov'd-- I am to pray you, not to itrain my speech To grosser issues, nor to larger reach, Than to suspicion. Oth. I will not. Jago. Should you do so, my lord, My speech would fall into fuilch vile success, Which my thoughts aim not at. Ca/io's my worthy friend. My lord, I fee you're mov'd-- Othb. No, not much mov'd--. I do not think but Defdemona's honefit. Jago. Long live (he so; and long live you to think so. Otrh. And yet how nature erring from it self---- Jago. Ay, there's the point;-- as (to be bold with you) Not to asset many proposed matches Of her own clime, complexion and degree, Whereto we fee in all things nature tends: Soh! one may fminell in such, a will moist rank, Foul difproportions, thoughts unnatural. But, pardon me, I do not in position Diftintly speak of her, tho' I may fear Her will, recoiling to her better judgment, May fall to match you with her country forms, And haply so repent. Oth.

In the mean time, Let me be thought too bufie in my fears, (As worthy cause I have to fear I am,) And hold her free, I do beseech your hoanour. Oth. Fear not my government. Jago.

there are Tome Speeches (in oneor two Scenes only) the fame: And we have there the conclusion of the Play, which is manifestly want- ing in all the subsequent Editions, as well as the latter part of the lafit Ad, manifefitly better, and clear of that ,impertinent Pro- lixity which is in the common E- ditions.
