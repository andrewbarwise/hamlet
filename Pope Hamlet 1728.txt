Mar. Horatio savs, 'tis gut our phantafie, And will not let belief take hold of him, Touching this dreaded fight, 'twice seen of us; Therefore I have intreated him along With us, to watch the minutes of this night, That if again this apparition come, He may approve our eyes, and speak to it.,Her. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear. Ber. Sit down a while, And let us once again aflail your ears, That are so fortified against our flory, What we have two nights seen.,Her. Well, fit we down, And let us hear Sernardo speak of this.,Ber.

Is not this something more than phantafie What think you of it Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe, Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes.,Mar. Is it not like the King Hor. As thou art to thy self. Such was the very armour he had on, When he th'ambitious Norway combated: So frown'd he once, when in an angry parle, He smote the fleaded a Polafk on the ice. 'Tis itrange -,Mtr. Thus twice before, and just at this b dead houri, With martial stalk, hath he gone by our watch.,Hor. In what particular thought to work, I know not : But in the gross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some frange eruption to our state.,Mar. Good now fit down, and tell me, he that knows,, Why this fame ftrit and moft-obfervant watch So nightly toils the subje&s of the land ? And why such daily cast of brazen cannon, And foreign mart for implements of war Why such impress of shipwrights, whose fore task Does not diviae the funday from the week .

He ufjs the word Polack again, as. z, fcne 4. b famt.
Who is't that can inform me ?,Hor. That can I, At least the whisper goes so. Our last King, Whose image even but now appear'd to us. Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, (Thereto prickt on by a most emulate pride) Dar'd to the fiht. In which, our valiant hamlet, (For so this fide of our known world efteem'd him) Did flay this Fortinbras: who by seal'd compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit (with his life) all those his lands Which he stood seiz'd of to the Conqueror: Against the which, a moiety competent Was gaged by our King; which had return To the inheritance of Fcrinbras, Had he been vanquifhsr, as by that cov'nant And carriage of the articles defign'd, His fell to Hamlet. Now youn_ Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and fuil, Hath in the skirts of Noriway, here and there, Shark'd up a lift of landless resolutes, For food and dyet, to some enterprize That hath a stomach in't: which is no other, And it doth well appear unto our slate, But to recover of us by strong hand And terms compulfative, those foresaid lands So by his father loft: and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch, and the chief head Of this pob-hafte and romage in the land.,Eer. I tl:ink it be no other, but even so: Well may it fort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch so like the King, That was and is the question of these wars.,Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. In the most high and t palmy state of Rome, A little ere thermightieft Yulius fell, The graves stood tenantless, the Iheeted dead,Did' f palmy for vicorious; in the other editions flou- rishing.
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman fireets, Stars fhon with trains of fire, dews of blood fell, Disasters veil'd the fun, and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire sands, Was sick almost to doom's-day with eclipse. And even the like precurfe of fierce events, As harbingers preceding fiill the fates, And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heav'n and earth together demonstrated Unto our climatures and country-men.,Enter Ghofl again.

[Exit Gbof, We do it wrong, being To majestical, To offer it the hlew of violence; For it is as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows, malicious mockery.,Eer. It was about to speak, when the cock crew. Hor. And then it flarted like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons. I have heard, The cock that is the trumpet to the morn,
Doth with his lofty and Ihrill-founding throat Awake the God of day; and at his warning, Whether in tea or fire, in earth or air, Th' extravagant and erring spirit hyes To his conine. And of the truth herein, This present object made probation.,Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some fay, that ever 'gainft that season comes Wherein- our Saviour's birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning fingeth all night long: And then, they fay, no spirit walks abroad, The nights are wholfome, then no pTanets strike, BNo Fairy takes, no witch hath power to charm; So hallowed and so gracious is the time.,Her. So have I heard, and do in part believe it, But look, the morn in ruffet mantle clad, Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill; Break we our watch up, and biv my advice Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet. For upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him: Do you content we Ihall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty l,Mar.

That we with wisest sorrow think on him, Together with remembrance of our selves. Therefore our sometime sifter, now our Queen, Th' imperial jointress of this warlike Itate, Have we, as 'twere, with a defeated joy, With one auspicious, and one dropping eye, With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole, Taken to wife. Nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along, (for all, our thanks.) Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth; Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame; Colleaoued with this dream of his advantage; He hal fail'd not to pester us with meflage, Importing the surrender of those lands Loft by his father, by all bands of law To our moflt valiant brother. So much for him. Now for our self, and for this time of meeting: Thus much the business is. We have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fsrtinbras, Who impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress His further gate herein; in that the levies, The lifts, and full proportions are all made Out of his fubjefs: And we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you Voltimand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norutay; Giving to you no further personal power Of treaty with the King, more than the scope Which there dilated articles allow.

And lose your voice. What would't thou beg Laertcs That fhail not be my offer, not thy asking?

Good Hamlet cast thy a nighted colour off, And let thine eve look like a friend on Denmark.

'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, To give tlefe mourning duties to your father: But you must know, your father loft a father, That father his, and the surviver bound In filial obligation, for some term To do obsequious sorrow. But to persevere In obstinate condolement, is a course Of impious stubbornness, unmanly grief. Jr Ihews a will most incorrec to heav'n, A heart unfortify'd, a mind impatient, An understanding simple, and unfchool'd For what we know mull be, and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we, in our peevifli 6ppofition, Take it to heart . fie! 'tis a fault.to heav'n, A fault against the dead, a fault t. nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theam Is death of fathers, and who still hath cry'd, From the first coarse, 'till he that died to-day, " This must be so." We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father: for let the world take note, You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love, Than that which dearest father bears his son, Do I impart tow'rd you. For your intent In going back to school to Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire: And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eve, Our chiefeft courtier, cousin, and our son.,_ueen.

I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never afted: or if it was, not above once, for the play I remember pleas'd not the million, 'twas Caviar to the general; but it was, (as I receiv'd it, and others, whose judgment in such matters cryed in the top of mine) an excellent play; well digeted in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cun- ning. I remember one laid, there was no d salt ini the lines, to make the matter savoury, nor no mat- ter in the phrase, that might indite the author of t affelion; but call'd it, an honeit method. One speech in it I chiefly lov'd; 'twas Efneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line, let me fee, let me fee - The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast. It is not so - it begins with Pyrrhus. The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose fable arms Black as his purpose, did the night resemble When he lay couched in the ominous horse; Hath now his dread and black completion lmear'd With heraldry more dismal; head to foot Now is he total geules; horridly trickt With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, B]k'd and impafted with the parching e fires, That lend a tyrannous and damned light To murthers vile.

Pcl. 'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent, and good discretion.,I P.iy. Anon he finds him, Striking, too short, at Greeks. His antique sword, Rebellious to his arm, lies where it fills Repugnant to command; unequal match'd, Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage trikes wide; But with the whif and wind of his fell sword Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless ilium, Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Fyrrhus' ear. For lo, his sword, Which was declining on the milky head Of rev'rend Priam, feem'd i'th' air to flick: So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus flood, And like a neutral to his will and matter, Did nothing. But as we often fee against some torm, A silence in the heav'ns, the rack fland still, The bold winds speechless, and the orb below As ihufh as death: anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region. So after Pyrrhus' pause, A rowsed vengeance sets him new a-work, And never did the Cyclops hammers fall On Mars his armour, forg'd for proof eterne, With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword Now falls on Priam.- Out, out, thou (trumpet-fortune ! all you gods, In general fynod take away her power: Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel, And bowl the round nave down the hill of heav'n, As low as to the fiends.,PcI.
